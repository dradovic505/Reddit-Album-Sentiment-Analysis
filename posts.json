As Fantano put it [here](https://youtu.be/QBtU46L3oho?t=861),  this leak could be re-tooled. It could be mastered and made into something less skeletal of a project. It could be made into something much more. \n\nI'm in favour of contacting The Life of Paul creator to see if this is a project he could give a little love too. We all unanimously loved what he did with The Life of Pablo. \n\nWho else is down for this concept?",

It was 7 tracks and yea we got KSG too, but fans definitely felt like they could've had more, which is why he announced the Yandhi album in the first place: he said himself that we needed a \"full\" Kanye album. \nSo the fans aren't super satisfied and want more music.\n\nThen there's Kanye in the public image, in which everyone basically saw him announce a mental illness then show absolutely no responsibility in controlling it, whilst supporting one of the most hated figures in the world right now and yelling poopity scoop and then releasing an album that was generally perceived as his 8th best album out of 8. Personally I think Ye is a very important emotional step for Kanye but it's not like Pitchfork is going to agree.\n\nSo the fans aren't satisfied, the general public is even less satisfied (if anything, annoyed with him), and the media (besides Forbes) still rejects most things he does. And while this is unfortunate, as always Ye will prevail with his music, which is why I DON'T UNDERSTAND why he wouldn't even seem to be WORKING on anything after releasing too little and causing too much controversy. In the past this is exactly when Kanye would bring everyone back to loving him (MBDTF, TLOP sorta), but he's just remaining dormant.\n\nHe loses status, fans, and money every day that goes past without a new album, you'd think he'd at least be on it by now or teasing something. Tbh he has certainly has not earned a break...",

It would make a lot of sense to release it in the summer when it would be the most memorable, as compared to a strange release like October or something when (while still being a potential masterpiece) might not help us to make good memories of the album because, whatever, it's fall.\n\nCome on Ye, I know you want to take your time perfecting this album, but if anything is certain it's that you can make this a Summer album that people will remember for years and associate good summer memories with.",

And while that would be awesome, I don't know if Kanye can reach that level of greatness again. I worry that Yandhi might come out to be like Ye or KSG...and don't get me wrong, those are great albums by themselves, but by Kanye's standards they aren't transcendent or game-changing like MBDTF or TCD were.

      "selftext": "I'm curious to know what was going on with him when you first became a fan, and how you thought/felt about it.\n\nAs a somewhat new fan, I unfortunately only discovered Kanye's music around April 2018, where the controversy over his TMZ comments and his tweets. My friend a year before that tried to get me into Kanye's music by listening to the albums from back to front but because I wasn't a fan of hip hop nothing really stuck with me. I'd always enjoyed Kanye West's singles that would get radio play, but never dedicated myself to being a fan.\n\nAt the time, the slavery comments kinda bugged me but as a white man, it wasn't my place to say anything on the subject. But I felt the media ran too far with the comments and took them out of context, which really annoyed me. So I started to become interested in the character of Kanye, watching video essays on his work (All Def Music, Volksgeist, Noisy Images) and listening to random tracks here and there. From seeing what other people saw from his work, I wanted to learn more. Good job he had two albums dropping the next month.\n\nEvery track I listened to from him was good, and often great/amazing. I had my favourite albums at the time but that list keeps changing. I became big on the Life of Pablo, but now MBDTF rules the list with an iron fist.\n\nWith no singles and hardly any marketing/promotion for Ye & KSG, I became consumed by the mystery of it, especially after hearing Kanye flew out the artists to Wyoming for a studio session (I'm from the UK but I understand Wyoming isn't the sort of place a rapper would go to record an album).\n\nThen came the listening party, and I was intrigued by how it was set up with all the artists and the industry gathering around the fire. I stayed up all night in my uni room to watch this and was listening to the tracks as they were coming through. As the quality was far off CDQ, I had to sort of judge the quality of the lyrics by the vibe that the other artists were giving off, but Ghost Town was when I fell in love with his music.\n\nGhost Town was so raw and seeing how Kanye reacted to it was great. If I remember I actually ended up crying, because the \"WE'RE STILL THE KIDS WE USED TO BE\" line actually resonated with how I had to move away from my childhood friends because of uni. I listened to that song over and over again, and still do.\n\nSince then, I've grown to appreciate all the albums within their own right (even Cruel Summer), and like all of us, will never hear Yandhi being released.\n\nComment below your experience.",

[Everyone was wearing purple](https://i.redd.it/ry57mev0fot21.jpg), the same color as the Yandhi CD.\n2. The whole \"mountain\" was a circle with an inner circle, also [resembling a CD](https://i.redd.it/vwjntq15lnt21.jpg).\n3. The entire thing was filmed through a circle filter, which also resembles a CD shape.\n4. A new track called \"Water\" was announced and performed and  can be seen on the [setlist](https://i.redd.it/te0xds25ant21.jpg)\n5. A producer that has helped Kanye in the past, Pierre Bourne, quickly posted [this](https://i.redd.it/lz7yadrkjot21.jpg) on his instagram story.\n6. The same producer, Pierre Bourne, also changed his twitter colors to purple. [(His twitter)](https://twitter.com/pierrebourne?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor)\n7. [Yummy](https://twitter.com/Alphakwak) posted [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D4eeb31WwAAww-9.jpg:large) on twitter a couple days ago, stating that Kanye will in fact announce something Yandhi related this weekend, however, after nothing was announced, he has just now tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/Alphakwak/status/1120038346699493377)\n8. When the new track, \"Water\" was performed the people in the inner circle of the \"CD\" on the mountain began walking around in a circle, acting as if the CD was spinning, being played. (Credits to /u/hymenbuster99)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: [Update](https://i.redd.it/l349xlxespt21.jpg) to the Yummy post, apparently Kanye wasn't ready to announce a release date yet. Maybe it'll be announced soon?\n\n(will keep updating list as things go on)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if I've missed anything. I know nothing was ever really promised regarding Yandhi and the Sunday Service at Coachella, but I can't help but feel this is all intentional, Kanye knows exactly what he is doing.",

So, what if the Coachella performance is actually the listening party? \nObviously this theory doesn\u2019t have much to go on other than the fact that Kanye does listening parties that are live-streamed, and that Coachella is being live-streamed. The other main problem with this theory is that Kanye is preforming on Easter Sunday and music is typically released on Fridays, so maybe he would only tease some Yandhi songs for the official release on the following Friday? Take this all with a grain of salt, as there is no real evidence supporting this theory as of now, but it\u2019s definitely something I could see Kanye doing, plus it would be an awesome surprise for everyone.",

      "selftext": "For quite some time now, people have viewed Kanye West as a divisive individual.\n\nRegardless of what you might think of the man's music, there's no denying that he has managed to capture the spotlight in a number of inflammatory ways. For instance, who can forget the time that he stormed onstage during Taylor Swift's award acceptance, ostensibly in an effort to hit on Beyonc\u00e9? More recently, of course, the man (currently) known as \"Yeezy\" paid a visit to the White House, where he expounded on a number of bizarre, unwise, or just ill-informed perspectives.\n\nWhat if there was a method to that madness, though?\n\nWhat if Kanye West's entire public life \u2013 from his ramblings to his attention-attracting shenanigans \u2013 was an act?\n\nOn the surface, the claim seems absurd... but it isn't without its merits. After all, even the people who refer to the man as a genius are quick to suggest that his aberrant behavior is simply the result of his having a very unique mind. Surely, then, there must be some evidence that he's playing his audience for fools; some indication that Mister West is secretly enacting an elaborate practical joke on the world.\n\nIn fact, that evidence exists: It's in The Kanye Kode.\n\nA complete breakdown of this cypher's nature would require entirely too much detail to fit into a single Reddit comment, but the basic overview is simple enough to explain: Each one of Kanye West's albums contains a hidden message; a clue which can be discovered by employing its title as a key and its track list as a collection of letters. Parsing The College Dropout, for example, ultimately reveals the phrase \"Words hidden here.\"\n\nWhen decrypted, a (seemingly incomplete) message appears:\n\n \"Words hidden here\" (The College Dropout)\n\"In plain sight\" (Late Registration)\n\"Just keep looking\" (Graduation)\n\"Discover the truth\" (808s & Heartbreak)\n\"It is all a big joke\" (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\"I am the punchline\" (Yeezus)\n\"Look at Andy\" (The Life of Pablo)\n\"See the vision\" (Ye)\n\n Those individuals who are passionate about The Kanye Kode are of the opinion that Yandhi \u2013 the release date for which has not been confirmed at the time of this writing \u2013 will offer the phrase \"Thank you very much.\" This, when combined with the mention of \"Andy\" in the message from The Life of Pablo, makes the far-reaching prank all the more evident: \"Andy,\" it seems, refers to Andy Kaufman, the notorious comedian and practical joker who was known for saying \"Thank you very much!\" at the ends of his sets.\n\nWith this in mind, the \"truth\" we are meant to discover becomes evident:\n\nKanye West is a genius... and he has hidden the punchline to his joke \u2013 himself \u2013 in plain sight.\n\nEither that, or he's just a wildly unpredictable buffoon who acts before he thinks.\n\nTL;DR: \"The Kanye Kode\" proves that Kanye West is following in Andy Kaufman's footsteps.\n\nCredit:/u/RamesesThePigeon ",

The wait in comparison to other albums\nI'm sure we all remember how long the wait between Pablo and ye or between Yeezus and Pablo etc. My point is to question whether  we are justified to be so frustrated and expect this album to be out so soon. Realistically I don't think September would have been enough time for it to be as good as we want it to be.\n\n2. Kanye's Lawsuit \nThis fight for Kanye to free himself from his contract is likely a big factor in this wait. I doubt he'd wanna release anything until the legal bullshit is over. \n\n3. Other fanbases are waiting\nA lot of other artists' fanbases are waiting for a project to be released: Frank Ocean, Childish Gambino, Tyler the Creator, Kendrick Lamar etc. And I think this community has a lot of crossover with those fanbases which is why we're so anxious and upset about this wait.",

The only point of contact I was given was his school email, so I promptly sent him a message. After a month or two of not hearing back, he finally reached out and gave me his Snapchat username. We got to talking a little bit, and found that we had a very similar taste in music- especially that our favorite artist of all time was Kanye West.\n\nHonestly, throughout the year, we weren't too close. We would be in the room together, but we'd mostly be doing our own thing- he'd be playing his Xbox or watching movies/TV, and I'd be on my phone Skyping my girlfriend, mostly. However, we would try to keep each other up to date on the latest Kanye news. When Kanye was on SNL, we watched it together, anxiously awaiting the release of Yandhi, even though it never came. The lock screen of his iPhone was the Kids See Ghost album cover, and that inspired me to make my laptop's desktop background the mountains from the cover of ye.\n\nLast night, I returned to campus after going home to the weekend to find that Joey had killed himself. I don't know enough about the situation to explain why, and I'm not sure that I ever will. But I know that he browsed this sub occasionally. Kanye was honestly the biggest thing that bonded us together, and I'll forever be grateful for that. I just felt that it would be meaningful to write a little about Joey here.\n\nRest in Peace, Joey... I promise that we'll listen to Yandhi someday...",

He gets a bad rep for the comments he made on trump and the other pointless stuff but he would have undoubtedly ended up as a fan favorite and GOAT had he died after MBDTF.

      "selftext": "Since you guys hated mine so much last time I\u2019m gonna try and actually explain it.\n\n8. Yeezus (5/10)\n\nThis is by no means a bad album, I just personally don\u2019t enjoy it as much. I appreciate how experimental Kanye was, and it has some of his best songs. The production can be really nice, but sometimes it\u2019s a little too loud or too abrasive for me. Also, I think he\u2019s lacking lyrically on this project. A Yeezus EP with my favorite tracks would be amazing, but as it stands this is my least favorite solo album because it\u2019s pretty inconsistent in terms of quality.\n\nBest Tracks: Hold My Liquor, Blood on the Leaves, New Slaves, Black Skinhead\n\nWorst Track: Send It Up\n\n7. ye (7/10)\n\nThis is also by no means a bad album, but you can tell it was put together in 2 weeks. Ghost Town is the only real highlight on this album for me. Also, I think the concept of this album as addressing Kanye\u2019s mental health issues is really interesting, but a lot of times it gets bogged down by some of his cornier lyrics (@All Mine.)\n\nBest Track: Ghost Town\n\nWorst Track: All Mine\n\n6. 808s (8/10)\n\nI love how experimental this album is compared to Kanye\u2019s earlier work. It sounds so different than anything he had ever made before. Other than a couple misfires, such as See You in My Nightmares and Bad News, 808s is really cohesive. Also cool to see how many artists have been inspired by this album.\n\nBest Tracks: Street Lights, Love Lockdown, Heartless, Welcome to Heartbreak\n\nWorst Track: See You in My Nightmares\n\n5. Life of Pablo (8/10)\n\nPablo has some of Kanye\u2019s best songs of all time, and is one of the best produced albums of his entire career. However, it\u2019s pretty inconsistent, and doesn\u2019t really stick to the supposed gospel theme of the album.\n\nBest Tracks: Ultralight Beam, Waves, No More Parties in LA, Saint Pablo, Famous\n\nWorst Track: Facts (Charlie Heat Version)\n\n4. Graduation (9/10)\n\nThis is one of my personal favorites, and it\u2019s an extremely ambitious album. I love the synths throughout the whole project, and it has some of Kanye\u2019s best sampling (I Wonder, Champion, etc.) A couple songs sound a little dated, but other than that it\u2019s a very quality album.\n\nBest Tracks: Good Morning, Flashing Lights, Homecoming, Can\u2019t Tell Me Nothing\n\nWorst Track: Barry Bonds\n\n3. College Dropout (9/10)\n\nA classic album with very few flaws, and one of my favorites to go back to. Kanye\u2019s lyricism on this project is the best it\u2019s ever been, and I love the chipmunk soul samples throughout the project. Plus, it\u2019s still his most relatable album.\n\nBest Tracks: Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down, Two Words, All Falls Down, Spaceship, We Don\u2019t Care\n\nWorst Track: New Workout Plan\n\n2. Late Registration (9/10)\n\nThe first Kanye album I ever listened to (for some reason.) The production is flawless, the instrumentals are gorgeous, and it has some of Kanye\u2019s wittiest lyrics. The only flaw in the album is that it\u2019s a little too long.\n\nBest Tracks: Touch the Sky, Roses, Diamonds from Sierra Leone, Gone, Crack Music\n\nWorst Track: Bring Me Down\n\n1. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (10/10)\n\nThere\u2019s nothing I can say about this album that hasn\u2019t already been said. My favorite album of all time.\n\nBest Tracks: Lost in the World, Runaway, Gorgeous, Devil in a New Dress, Power, All of the Lights\n\nWorst Track: None\n\n",

      "selftext": "tldr at the end \n\ni first properly listened to Kanye when ye came out. i used to be a big taylor swift fan back when i was a little younger and still enjoy some of her music, but back then i was totally on the \u2018fuck kanye\u2019 gang. but i decided to give ye a listen anyway because daytona was so damn good. and i genuinely loved it. it was 2am and i was in my bed listening to ye in the dark and it was short but beautiful. i especially loved the production and use of samples on \u2018no mistakes\u2019. \n\nit was a while after kids see ghosts dropped that i decided i need to check out what else kanye has got. and i really wasn\u2019t ready for it, honestly. i started from the beginning, at the college dropout. i was blown away once again, loving this one even more and all the soul samples and old school hip-hop was all just my type. \n\nthen came late registration, equally beautiful, albeit a bit grander, but probably less personally important to me as college dropout affected me more deeply in a way since i\u2019m a musician myself (multi-instrumentalist and singer) and really don\u2019t wish to college and just work on my music cause it means everything to me but probably will be have to go anyway. this album obviously has so many incredible songs. \u2018hey mama\u2019 made me smile constantly throughout, and then also feel sad when i recalled his mother actually passed away (the grammy performance is heartbreakingly beautiful). \n\nthen was graduation, the sound was very different and initially took me a bit to get into. but then eventually it grew on me hard. \u2018i wonder\u2019 off it is probably one of my fav ye songs, along with \u2018good morning\u2019. \n\n808s and heartbreak. what can i even say? i listen to a lot of deep indie, depressed music often in relation to my bipolar phases, and while this album actually was a lot less depth than most of that, it was still so raw and real. i\u2019ve never been a big fan of autotune but ye used it so revolutionarily and it\u2019s incredible. i love most everything on this album. it\u2019s gorgeous. \n\nwhich leads us to my beautiful dark twisted fantasy. goddamn, what an album. i didn\u2019t actually like most of it on first listen. just didn\u2019t seem like my type. the second listen did it, though. i absolutely am in constant awe of this album, it\u2019s so damn great. the grand production, and the general mania of it all is something i relate to a lot, often. lost in the world also has justin vernon\u2019s (bon iver) \u2018woods\u2019 in it and i\u2019ve been a long term bon iver fan and \u2018woods\u2019 is one of my favourite musical pieces of all time. i love it. i love kanye\u2019s taste and use of music. \n\nyeezus is probably among the ye music that i like lesser than most of his other stuff. it\u2019s an incredible album, and i realise and admire its objective musical greatness. but it\u2019s just not my personal taste most of the time, with all the slightly rough, noisy sort of production. \n\nthe life of pablo, it\u2019s another one of my favourite albums of all time. it had me captivated right from the first second i pressed \u2018play\u2019 to the end of saint pablo. it\u2019s such beauty, it\u2019s absolutely insane. there\u2019s too many good tracks to name and the features and samples are all so, so good. i adore this album, it\u2019s everything. \n\nall in all, kanye helps me get myself a little more as i relate to the sort of feelings he gets and his bipolar and breakdowns and everything. i don\u2019t hate him for his political opinions or even his extra controversial statements, because the music is forever going to be greater than all of that. i\u2019m very excited for yandhi and was let down hard when it didn\u2019t drop when it was supposed to, though that only means he\u2019s perfecting it even more. kanye is a genius, and i genuinely believe he is probably one of the greatest producers to music has ever seen. \n\ni know you guys don\u2019t usually care about teen fans much and just think of us as young and stupid, but i hope y\u2019all appreciate this cause at the end of the day, we\u2019re all wavy people enjoying kanye\u2019s genius, so how does age ever even matter. \n\nranking his albums is hard asf, but i\u2019ve tried with my very much personal opinion. every kanye album is his greatest, depending on the person listening:\n\n1.\tThe College Dropout,\n808s and Heartbreaks,\nThe Life Of Pablo\n2.\tMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\nLate Registration \n3.\tYe,\nGraduation\n4.\tYeezus\n\nwhen i include collab albums, \n\n1.\tKids See Ghosts\n2.\tWatch The Thrown \n\nthat\u2019s just my personal opinion, couldn\u2019t possibly rank by one album per ranking hahah. i love this community, thank you all for existing and stay wavy \ud83c\udf0a\n\ntldr- listened to ye because i loved daytona and decided to listen to every album starting from the college dropout. absolutely loved it and love kanye and this community. \n\n",

I have visceral memories of vibing out to Kanye's album whacked out on sedatives while experiencing a manic episode. I felt a connection the great man when he referred to Lexapro and going through an episode on FML. Being in a mentally ill state I started to believe I was connected with Ye as I too was in a car crash were I nearly died in when I was younger, look at how death missed my ass. Next experience of mania was when Ye came out funnily enough, and when Kanye revealed himself to be bipolar I thought it was a sign- I've got a superpower.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe realities of bipolar are a far cry from the outlandish heightened sense of self people experience in mania. Unfortunately, there are consequences to the actions that take place and usually a depressive episode follows suit. Some people in the bipolar community claim that Kanye is a bad role model for mental health issues because he glamourises mental illness, or stops taking medication, doesn't listen to therapists or creates further stigma by making the disorder seem plain crazy (which it definitely can be). I disagree, Kanye's path of coming to terms with mental illness while being in the spotlight provides a case study on the realities of bipolar and opens a conversation and wisdom from Ye himself through lived experience. I too believed my diagnosis was incorrect, didn't trust the medication, had grandiose ideas and rapid fired some statements that didn't really make sense to the outside world while being well meaning from a place within.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Kimmel last year Ye said people with mental health issues need to 'express themselves without fear of judgement' and I've definitely taken that on board. Kanye being so candid and relatable through his art and state of being has truly inspired me to open up and improve myself, same goes for Kid Cudi. Been feeling reborn lately, and I'm moving forward. I used to be so embarrassed of my label but now I own it and take better care of myself. I appreciate everything Ye's been doing to inspire a ton.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and I've been in a steady, happy place for a while now. Hopefully I don't have to become manic for Yandhi to drop :P.",

What I hope happens is that he releases what Yandhi is and then release a whole Sunday Service album after that. But knowing Ye he might\u2019ve already switched everything and I might be let down.

I'mma be like Gandhi- scratch that, Yandhi!\" and then slowly he fell out of the zone and when the day came to drop Yandhi he didn't have it done so he set black friday as the new release date or as a deadline to him. Black friday came to him faster than expected and probably said fuck it since he hasn't addressed anything about Yandhi after that. It's like when you have an assignmen due in a couple weeks and so you procrastinate until the due date comes and you haven't even started it y'know. I also see Yandhi as one of those things Kanye says when he's really in the zone like when he said he's gonna run for president or how when before Ye dropped he said he was gonna put a picture of his mom's surgeon on the cover but then changed it at the last minute.

But we can all but assume everything was scrapped except for 80 degrees due to the [tweet like](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/aijhzn/ronny_j_may_have_just_confirmed_my_tweet_that_80/) from Ronny J, along with it being what Kanye himself posted as a snippet was probably at the time, what he considered one of the best off the upcoming release of Yandhi so hopefully he keeps that one for the actual release. Besides 80 Degrees Stormy Night (as it was confirmed from the Sunday Sessions) (along with the leaked snippet) has made the album. Undoubtley it has been altered since then, but I believe the X feature still remains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"UGANDAN SESSIONS\"***\n\nWe all know Kanye went to Africa to supposedly finish the album, In my opinion I feel like he got very little musically done there, but just gained more inspiration, for where he wanted to direct the album, almost no leaks came Uganda, [But I'll link some here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/9o37xs/i_hope_this_makes_it_on_the_album/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"SUNDAY SESSIONS\"***\n\nThe Sunday Services is where I believe Uganda inspired Kanye to go back to his ROOTS, a lot of soul sampling, that is why he later went to buy some more sampling material, [(View Here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dshPHnGdk_c). These sessions clearly from those recording have been to us new songs. I'm sure these can be confirmed on the album. That is why Stormy Night, and The Garden come from as posted [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtMNNoBhcsg/). The next two while still unnamed from this weeks Sunday Service Outside we can only hope and pray are on the album.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***\"IN MY OPINION\"***\n\nI think Kanye is really going to put out some MBDTF and 808's type quality here,\n\nI'm sure he took out 6ix9ine's feature, just with all the stuff he got into is to much negative energy, Also I think Kanye knows that unless 6ix9ine went insane on his verses no one wants to hear him and that that song got completely scrapped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComment stuff you know and other links, and I will keep compiling it all up here. Thanks again\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Nearly every snippet of Yandhi we have gotten features Kanye singing on somewhat bare trap beats.\n\nThe strongest point for this theory would be the link between Kanye's use of a choir. A leaked recording surfaced of the SHMG track 'I Feel Like That' leaking but this time with the inclusion of a choir. This is a pretty clear connection to the Sunday Services that Kanye has been hosting over the past few weeks.\n\nAnother odd parallel would be the heavy trap influence that is clear in Yandhi snippets and is peppered throughout SHMG.",

      "selftext": "For quite some time now, people have viewed Kanye West as a divisive individual.\n\nRegardless of what you might think of the man's music, there's no denying that he has managed to capture the spotlight in a number of inflammatory ways. For instance, who can forget the time that he stormed onstage during Taylor Swift's award acceptance, ostensibly in an effort to hit on Beyonc\u00e9? More recently, of course, the man (currently) known as \"Yeezy\" paid a visit to the White House, where he expounded on a number of bizarre, unwise, or just ill-informed perspectives.\n\nWhat if there was a method to that madness, though?\n\nWhat if Kanye West's entire public life \u2013 from his ramblings to his attention-attracting shenanigans \u2013 was an act?\n\nOn the surface, the claim seems absurd... but it isn't without its merits. After all, even the people who refer to the man as a genius are quick to suggest that his aberrant behavior is simply the result of his having a very unique mind. Surely, then, there must be some evidence that he's playing his audience for fools; some indication that Mister West is secretly enacting an elaborate practical joke on the world.\n\nIn fact, that evidence exists: It's in The Kanye Kode.\n\nA complete breakdown of this cypher's nature would require entirely too much detail to fit into a single Reddit comment, but the basic overview is simple enough to explain: Each one of Kanye West's albums contains a hidden message; a clue which can be discovered by employing its title as a key and its track list as a collection of letters. Parsing The College Dropout, for example, ultimately reveals the phrase \"Words hidden here.\"\n\nWhen decrypted, a (seemingly incomplete) message appears:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\n\"Words hidden here\" (The College Dropout)\n\"In plain sight\" (Late Registration)\n\"Just keep looking\" (Graduation)\n\"Discover the truth\" (808s & Heartbreak)\n\"It is all a big joke\" (My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy)\n\"I am the punchline\" (Yeezus)\n\"Look at Andy\" (The Life of Pablo)\n\"See the vision\" (Ye)\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nThose individuals who are passionate about The Kanye Kode are of the opinion that Yandhi \u2013 the release date for which has not been confirmed at the time of this writing \u2013 will offer the phrase \"Thank you very much.\" This, when combined with the mention of \"Andy\" in the message from The Life of Pablo, makes the far-reaching prank all the more evident: \"Andy,\" it seems, refers to Andy Kaufman, the notorious comedian and practical joker who was known for saying \"Thank you very much!\" at the ends of his sets. \n\nWith this in mind, the \"truth\" we are meant to discover becomes evident:\n\nKanye West is a genius... and he has hidden the punchline to his joke \u2013 himself \u2013 in plain sight.\n\nEither that, or he's just a wildly unpredictable buffoon who acts before he thinks.\n\nTL;DR: \"The Kanye Kode\" proves that Kanye West is following in Andy Kaufman's footsteps.",

You start seeing a lot more technology and sampling in Hip-Hop after MBDTF\u2019s massive success. In my opinion, Kanye always has been a master at sampling. \n\nIt\u2019s just popular to hate him right now because of his endorsement of Donald Trump. I for one, respect his intention of showing his audience new ideas and trying to get them to think for themselves. It\u2019s admirable to me how he speaks his mind without worrying about public perception. This is a brave stance to have for someone who\u2019s career is based on people consuming his product. If anything, his continual success in the music industry despite his negative perception is only a testament to his music. Yes, he makes missteps. But it\u2019s the exposed thought process of someone who\u2019s trying to express his ideas in the best way. To me, the authenticity is appreciated, especially among the sterile & composed statements from artists that automatically just align with the status quo and have nothing to say.\n\nI can\u2019t wait for Yandhi",

TLOP was a gospel album in the words of Kanye. It showed in songs specifically like Ultralight Beam. I believe that this choir will have a big part in Yandhi and give a soul/gospel vibe. And I think yeezus fits into this because it\u2019s probably going to be super experimental as the album was which is why it was so great. And small detail, I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t related but in all the Sunday Service videos the lighting is always purple which resembles the Yandhi cover which is as well purple. \n\nTLDR; Yandhi will be a mix of TLOP and Yeezus.

He quickly became my favourite artist.  What a year it's been. I remember when Kanye's twitter came back, the insane tweets, the TMZ interview and the Manic Trump speeches. I remember how exited I was when he announced kids see ghosts and his Solo album. Good summer was amazing. Yandhi announcement and delays. The kid see ghosts performance. I went through some dark periods and Kanye's music was always there to help me. Kanye made this year alot more exciting and fun.\nThank you Kanye ",

It was very late at night, so the subway was mostly empty except for a man nodding off, wearing some sweats and a large military jacket. I sat across from him. After a few minutes the man jerked awake. I had the sudden urge to go up and kiss the man's ass - I was presented with the presence of god. I controlled my primal urges, and instead pretended not to be surprised. He looked at me, I nodded my head, and he nodded back. Soon after he pulled out his yePhone, and started swiping the screen. In the windows of the dimly lit train, I saw the reflection of the phone. Kanye was on Reddit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter scrolling through the front page, Kanye cautiously looked around, and clicked on the r/Kanye subreddit link. As the posts loaded it became clear he hadn't visited in a while, as I heard \"why the fuck are these people talking about graduation?\". The confusion soon cleared, only to be replaced with an expression of childish wonder. As he scrolled further, I noticed Kanye's bulge was becoming bigger. The wonderment turned to a look of pure evil, as Kanye put his hands down his pants and pulled out his large member. He started stroking it slowly, and then faster and faster. As he got closer to his finish, he started orgasmically yelling out his own name.  At this point, I felt some sort of power run through me, a power that no one man should have. He called kim and told her he didn't need her anymore, he had his own. After finishing, kanye calmly got up and snapped his phone in two. As he walked past me, he didn't bother to pull up his sweatpants, after all it was 3 AM in Chicago, having pants on would get you robbed. Before getting off, he put his hand on my shoulder and said that I could have one wish.\n\nIf you rode the blue line and found a stain on one of the seats, know that it is the literal spawn of god. Kiss it, worship it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s: I asked for Yandhi.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

I think??\n\nMore TLOP?\n\nSomething else you have a hunch for?\n\nHonestly after his first 3 albums all his music has showcased quite abstract/complex songs with not-so-straight forward sounds. Kanye\u2019s discography kind of reminds me of Radiohead or the Beatles... starting off with solid but poppy/straight forward music and then getting looser and looser with their structure and more abstract with time. I\u2019m not criticizing his early work btw, it was perfection.\n\nSo what\u2019s Yandhi going to be like? Will it be like Gandhi made it? Spiritual?\n\nHopefully we will know this year.

Even the not-that-autotuned Melly bits are sounding nice.\nSo obviously it is no masterpiece, but a really fun and catchy song, which I came to realize only after some listens.

This led to a community wide time travel to the year 2007, in which Kanye released his third solo album \"Graduation\". Going forward, to avoid entrapment in 2007, the community will time travel one year every 3 days. On each day of departure, a time travel announcement will be posted and the shift will commence.\n\nThe following schedule shall be our itinerary in time:\n\n|Feb 1 - Feb 3: 2008|Feb 13 - Feb 15: 2012|Feb 25 - Feb 27: 2016|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Feb 4 - Feb 6: 2009|Feb 16 - Feb 18: 2013|Feb 28 - Mar 2: 2017|\n|Feb 7 - Feb 9: 2010|Feb 19 - Feb 21: 2014|Mar 3 - Mar 5: 2018|\n|Feb 10 - Feb 12: 2011|Feb 22 - Feb 24: 2015|Mar 6: Return to 2019|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn March 6th, we will end our adventure and return to 2019: The Year of Yandhi. By this point, every participant will have experienced the community feeling of every major Kanye West moment since 2007. This is something special, as a community we have really only been able to experience the big moments from after the Dark Fantasy era.\n\nSo, come one come all, if ye dare. Enter the **Kanye Time Machine** ^(patent pending)  and see the highlights and low-lights of the greatest artist of his generation.\n\n\\[KWTM\\] (Kanye West Time Machine) will mark the time jump announcements, which will occur every 3 days at 12:00AM EST.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: THE FIRST TIME SHIFT HAS COMMENCED.

That being said, I feel like the majority of this sub has forgotten who we are dealing with. Kanye Fucking West.\n\nSince even before the College Dropout debuted, Kanye has made it clear that he is the biggest Kanye fan in the world. He almost always announces drop dates because he LOVES the hype - just as much, if not more, than we do. (Please correct me if I am wrong, but I don't think any Kanye solo album has had a surprise drop). He even goes so far as to announce dates when he gets too excited, and the albums not even finished (\"After SNL\", \"Black Friday 2018\").\n\nAfter the Kids See Ghosts at CFG performance, Kanye tweeted: \"*It felt so good being on the stage last night with my brother Cudi. After performing again, I realize the new album I\u2019ve been working on isn\u2019t ready yet.*  ***I\u2019ll announce the release date once it\u2019s done****. Thank you for understanding\".* I feel like this community conveniently keeps forgetting this.\n\nYe wants to make the dropping and appreciation of this next album to be a moment in history. He's going to be too excited to be quiet and drop it unannounced. Let's all be patient for now & enjoy the 8 solo albums, 3 group albums, and countless singles/features from the greatest musical producer of his generation.",

MBDTF came from almost 2 years worth of work, and I think Kanye works better when he takes more time to really get into making the album.

Im gonna be ass backwards to some so lmk what you guys would change, I'm curious how many agree and disagree.\n\n11.Cruel Summer: Not enough Kanye to justify its existence in his discography. Peak Ye' when hes there tho,you can never sleep on Mercy,Clique,and New God Flow.\n\n10.Graduation: I know I'm gonna piss some of you guys of with graduation so low but I feel like its his least consistent album. Good Life,Barry Bonds,DNHG,and Big Brother all dont do it for me and whats left after I take those out really aint enough to get over Ye's other albums.\n\n9.Watch the Throne: This album goes so fuckin hard its ridiculous. Only reason its low is The Joy. I dont like that song at all and on top of that Jay isn't Ye sooo...\n\n8.Ye: For some reason I cant get what people dont like about this album. This was short,sweet,and the perfect encapulation of where ye is at and what he is about. 6 out of 7 songs were perfect(all but All Mine) and they came together so incredibly. Beauty behind the chaos,you can only kill somethin you love.\n\n7.KSG: Just peak mellow emotional Ye. When he goes harder,he either bein silly or he ain't talkin tough shit. Its just perfect.\n\n6. TCD: Our intro to god and he pulls through. Its just Breathe in Breathe out and NWP just aint the best. They good but they aint great. \n\nThe top 5 are all 10/10s, so i cant describe why im putting them over one another too well,but they got a ranking\n\n5.808's\n\n4.Yeezus\n\n3.Late Registgration\n\n2.TLOP\n\n1.MBDTF\n\nLmk where Im wrong or right thanks",

This tells me one thing: the album isn't being *radically* changed. \n\nFor one, 'Stormy Nights' was performed on Sunday Service, which could mean this Sunday might be the reveal of new material if they continue the same set-up. Also, the cook up session in Miami (featuring Timba, Lil Wayne, 2 Chainz, Migos - all artists already circulating around the project hype) shows that they're returning to finish and perfect certain features of the album. \n\nTherefore, I wouldn't be surprised if the project drops by february, if not sooner. The next Sunday Service will be the next big clue if Kanye remains silent. \n\nJust some thoughts. ",

I remembered when Kanye emulated (out of respect) Dilla's style in Common's Finding Forever album. Not only did Kanye do a great job, but he fucking murdered Dilla. IMO Dilla is sloppy, whereas Kanye perfected the craft.\n\nAnyways, I say that to say this, Kanye's recent shit (while I personally love it) is lacking due to his mental illness. That's just  my personal opinion. I don't doubt his abilities. In fact, I'm the biggest TLOP and KSG advocate. Where others see trash, I see brilliance in the idea that, he'll make what he wants to make when he wants to make it. These so called \"sloppy cuts\" are Kanye's true songs. The shit he wants to put out, the unpolished shit - and it's fucking incredible.\n\nThat being said, Yandhi snippets sound like the perfect mix of \"I don't give a fuck\" and \"I'll do a polished commercial album\" at the same time.\n\nI can't even image what Ye would put out if he didn't have the issues he has. He's on another level for sure, but not in a crazy way, more like a way where a motha fucka knows too much about the world and how it works and he decided to say fuck it.\n\nYe fan since the pre-college droupout mixtapes. Drunk but truth.\n\nWAVY",

      "selftext": "I already submitted this and it was surprisingly graded quickly (its worth about 40% of my midterm)\n\nMy formatting might be off due to me copying and pasting this on mobile.\n\nKanye Throughout The Years\n    Everybody who hasn\u2019t been living under a rock has heard some song from Kanye. It doesn't have to be the whole song, it doesn\u2019t matter if you heard it a block away at a party, or when you\u2019re flipping through the radio stations. It\u2019s that iconic beat and the mesmerizing lyrics that make you think \u201cHey, what\u2019s this song?\u201d. This is a reason why many Kanye fans are still fans to this day. Throughout his mental breakdowns, stress overloads and insensitive tweets, he still has many of his old fans still with him. It's the way he changes how people listen to music and how he makes the whole body feel. From the gospel choirs singing in the background of his older music to the mental health discussion of his more recent albums. He is always able to help the listener to understand his problems. He changed his name from Kanye, Yeezus, Yeezy, Pablo, Ye and soon Yandhi and he has also changed his music too. A song from 2004 sounds a lot different then his songs from 2018, but it still has that good ol\u2019 Kanye West vibe to it. While people may say Kanye hasn\u2019t evolved from him rapping from a mic hanging from a wire, He has changed throughout time because of the changes of lyrics, tempo, and message to society. \n    In 2004, Kanye West released \u2018The College Dropout\u2019, which was a 1 hour, 16-minute album compressed of 21 songs. Well, it really only included 17 because it had 3 skits and an introduction. While people may say those are worthless and a waste of their time. They\u2019re wrong because those skits that last a minute help to set the mood for the album. It's like the lights being dimmed at a candle-lit dinner or the neon lights of the dance floor. You have to be in the right mindset and mood to enjoy and experience an album to its fullest potential. There are arguably two of the most popular songs of \u2018The College Dropout\u2019, and they are Jesus Walks and Through the Wire. In the rap culture at that time, most of the songs talk about sex, drugs, and money, which Jesus Walks talks about racism, war and \u201cwar with ourselves\u201d. The song implements a gospel group made up of recovering drug addicts. With the army like footsteps and chants in the background, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s God\u2019s Army marching. Kanye talked about how hard it was to get the word Jesus on the radio because it would usually be censored with a word like \u2018him\u2019 or \u2018he\u2019. Religion being an important part of Kanye\u2019s life made this difficult. In the song he says. \u201cThey said you can rap about anything except for Jesus. That means guns, sex, lies, video tape. But if I talk about God my record won't get played.\u201d He talks about how he is facing many difficulties facing him in the world. He says. \u201cGod show me the way because the Devil's tryin' to break me down.\u201d This is a way that he is able to show that he is facing sins throughout his life and he is barely keeping afloat. The song talks about how he is filled with wrongs in his life and he believes that God will be able to show him the way and help him. Overall, \u2018Jesus Walks\u2019 is a religious song about Kanye\u2019s personal struggles with sins and wrongs and also about society as a whole. \nLater on in the album, Kanye had the song \u2018Through The Wire\u2019. One night after recording and producing beats, he got in a near-death crash in his rented Lexus after falling asleep at the wheel. He produced this song even though he had his mouth wired shut after the crash. The song had the choir and instrumentals of Chaka Khan\u2019s \u201cThrough the Fire\u201d, but it was just sped up and the pitch was changed. He heard this song while in recovery in the hospital and he loved the message of the song. In \u2018Through the Fire\u2019 it talks about standing up and passing all of the hardest things in life. He carried out this message in his song and talked about his near-death incident. He didn\u2019t give credit to Chaka Khan and instead, he gave credits to different artists. He named the song \u2018Through The Wire\u2019 because he literally had to produce the whole song through the wire in his mouth. This song helped him to gain more and more supporters and fans, which helped him to advance his career even further. It originally released as a single in 2002 and was later added to the album. He then waited another year to release another album.\nThat album was \u2018Late Registration\u2019 and it was released in 2005. This 1 hour and 10-minute long album included the names of Nas, Adam Levine, Jamie Foxx, Common, Really Doe and many more. The album explored and told stories of his personal struggles, political problems, the blood diamond trade, drug trafficking, healthcare, racism, and poverty. This album helped to get Kanye many awards such as 2006 Grammy Best Rap Album and Rolling Stone\u2019s Best Album of 2005. This was a different type of music by Kanye because he had a gospel feel to his music. In this album, he switched to a more trip-hop kind of music. Trip-hop is originated in Great Britain and is very popular in Bristol. This is a mix of electronic and also rap and is also known as downtempo. Kanye choose this type of music because he had previously liked Portishead. Throughout the album, he uses his music to tell a story, which he had been doing well previously. His music was able to appeal to everybody and everybody had that one thing that they could relate to. \nOne of the most popular songs of \u2018Late Registration\u2019 was Gold Digger. This song was released as a single almost a month before the album release and had an amazing single release with it breaking a digital download record with 80k downloads. This song was released with Jamie Foxx and told a story of a man being married to a woman who just liked him for the money. Later in the song, he talks about a black man who earned a fortune and leaves his selfless and loyal girlfriend for a white girl. This song was full of synthesizer noises and hand claps, which gave it that beat you can bounce your foot too. \nJumping forward to \u2018The Life of Pablo\u2019 the 7th studio recorded album by Kanye, which was released in 2016. This album took about 3 years to produce and was produced throughout the world. Recording sessions would be in Italy, Mexico, Canada, and the US and would be produced by many producers. The producer list has many successful producers from Metro Boomin and Mike Dean. The album featured artists from all over the rap scene, from Chance the Rapper to Young Thug and from Rihanna to Desiigner. Leading up to the release of the album, Kanye went to Twitter and tweeted about Bill Cosby, Wiz Khalifa, and snippets of Famous was leaked. He asserted that Bill Cosby was innocent after 50+ people came out for allegations against him. He talked about Wiz Khalifa and brought Amber Rose into it. This caused problems because they argued about sexual experiences. Once, snippets of \u201cFamous\u201d was released there was a lot of controversy in the lyrics. Kanye talked about how he \u201cmade that b**** famous\u201d, which was referring to him interfering with Taylor Swift\u2019s speech at the Grammys. This caused a long lasting feud between the two artists and it is still running to this day. \nOne of my personal favorite songs of Kanye is Ultralight Beam it is the introduction song of \u2018The Life of Pablo\u2019 and a song that I can personally vibe to. This song is a confession, a plea and forgiveness. This song seems like Kanye is not very present in it, and most of the song is the choir, organ, Kirk Franklin, Chance, The-Dream and Kelly Prince. The song starts off with a 4 year old who is possessed by the lord. It has that vibe to it that gives your goosebumps and makes your heart warm at the same time. During the introduction and beginning of the song you start to get goosebumps and as it goes on it goes away slowly. The second the chorus hit and the choppy beats hit it comes right back. The song talks about this person wanting to ask the lord for his forgiveness and that she knows, \u201cthat you\u2019ll take care of your child.\u201d This gospel theme carries out throughout the song and has a little something for everyone. \nOut of the three albums I have described they all have a different style to them. While \u201cThe College Dropout\u201d has that classic gospel feel to it and that older style of rap and it featured uplifting beats that make you want to dance. In the album \u2018Late Registration\u2019 it changes to more of a choppy beat, specifically a trip-hop beat. In \u2018Late Registration\u2019 Kanye raps about political, social and worldwide issues, while \u2018The College Dropout\u2019 features the same thing. Kanye hadn\u2019t changed his views between these two albums. On the other hand on \u2018Life of Pablo\u2019 goes back to the gospel side of Kanye, but has a lot of different issue than being listed before. This could be the beginning of a New Kanye, somebody who is completely different than the ones before. He brings up Him and Kim being like Mary and Joseph. Along with the difficulties of antidepressants and family, and how \u201cHe misses the Old Kanye\u201d. While College Dropout and Late Registration feature political, and socioeconomic, and religioous issues, Life Of Pablo brings up sex, the Old Kanye, and how difficult antidepressents air. These show how the advancement of Kanye\u2019s, lyrical and musical identity, along with his message to society. \n\n\nTL:DR I wrote a paper about Kanye\u2019s music style and meaning throughout his career. I focused on College Dropout, Late Registration and Life of Pablo. ",

He ditched Big Time Rush in the collaboration in favor of the newer, much more talented group, Big Time Croc! This takes a bunch of extra time as it is very hard to coordinate crocs, who scientists doubt can sing, let alone rap, into spitting sick bars in time for the collaboration.",

I'd also like to mention that I've been a little depressed and haven't had nicotine/tobacco for awhile. So my first dream I was on a very narrow bus with a driver, Kanye, and Myself. We were driving by a mix of mansions that looked like they belonged in Beverly Hills, and on the roads near my house, and we passed by my house as well. Along this drive Kanye played an unreleased song from an unreleased album with 12 songs (possibly Yandhi lol) I don't remember there being names or anything but the opening track had a very euphoric/beautiful sound it jolted me I've had a hard time describing what it sounded like after I woke up but it seemed very vivid at the time. It grabbed my attention at the beginning of our ride in the bus and also had Kanye ad-libbing in a soft soothing way. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy second dream was while I was napping today I'll get straight to the goods with this one. Again I was on a sort of rollercoaster but one that you wouldn't expect to go very fast and this time there were many people aboard including Chance who sat behind me. Kanye came up in the front of the ride floating...yes I'm serious he wasn't touching the ground lol. He simply this time said something about how he lives in us like in our heads and thoughts and then I felt an incredible feeling of ecstasy that seemed to again jolt me almost awake. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't really know what any of this all means I haven't had very vivid dreams lately until just these two. I know whenever I stop with tobacco for awhile I get some very interesting weird dreams but nothing like this. I think this just happened to be a combination of me stopping tobacco and my recent emotional state. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

      "selftext": "**Foreword.**\n\nI don't know how exactly I ended up being the type of person to bring up Kanye West in casual conversation. I don't know what it is more a case of - people asking me to explain things about him because they're interested, or me developing a tendency to go off on a Kanye tangent from any topic.\n\nRegardless of that, there's been many evenings where I found myself telling yet another short Kanye story to the most diverse groups of listeners that wanted to understand \"what's so special about this rapper dude with a god complex\". After a good number of rants, wildly varying in cohesion, an idea formed to write a little \"guide to Kanye\", perfect to use in those situations.\n\nWhile I was writing this, many friends had heard about it and asked for a copy, which made me take it a bit more seriously and properly write something I won't be ashamed of, so here you go everyone :)\n\n**Chapter 1. Intro.**\n\nEven among a group of people as rich in curious characters as music superstars, Kanye West is a figure that stands out as someone well known for his outlandish behavior. In most people's minds, his eccentricity is probably not the good kind. However, if you look a little further than the infamous Grammy speech, you might find his most frequently portrayed image to be skewed or exaggerated. Understandably so - after all, most \"people\" publications survive by portraying things in a way that will generate the most interest.\n\nI am going to attempt to paint a different, demystified image - one from a less sensationalist perspective. I will focus on things about Kanye that I find interesting, but of course you are free to decide how to feel about them. Not to say this will be free of personal opinion entirely, as the things I choose to mention are going to show my biases in their own way. However, I will try not to do that too much.\n\nI feel like the only fitting way for me to describe a person I've never met is, of course, through their own work. Therefore, I will go through ten Kanye West songs that I would consider \"essential\" to get a fuller view of him, be it for their influence, certain lyrics that show what he is about, or simply because of personal preference. I strongly recommend listening to the tracks mentioned as you read :)\n\n**Chapter 2. The Graduation Trilogy and why it's not an exaggeration that Kanye's music is revolutionary**\n\nLet's go about the music Ye has been releasing chronologically, both because it's a good way to structure something like this, and because early Kanye songs are the perfect example to use to change people's preconceptions of him. There is such a stark contrast between him there and the self-absorbed arrogant asshole image people usually have of him.\n\nWhen Kanye released his first album \"The College Dropout\", he was on about a very different thing - he was a guy to come into mainstream hip-hop and rap about his disillusion in the world, struggling with his plans for the future, being broke and lost. The music was documenting his own search for motivation and inspiration, going through hard times and finding the strength to go on, pursue his dreams and become who he really wanted to be - *\"Imma open up a store for aspiring MCs, won't sell em no dream but the inspiration is free\".*\n\nThat all happened in 2004, when 50 Cent was the highest selling artist, and the hip hop dominating the charts was exclusively gangster rap. Rap in the charts was synonymous to bling and limousines, money and hoes.\n\nNobody expected a guy like Kanye to sell. What's he rapping about again? Loving Jesus, loving his mom, missing his home city? Even Kanye himself didn't have illusions about his chances for success, and he was naturally quite frustrated with the state of hip hop at the time:\n\n*\"So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this*\n\n*They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus*\n\n*That means guns, sex, lies, videotape*\n\n*But if I talk about God my record won't get played?\"*\n\n* [Jesus Walks (recommended listening #1)](https://open.spotify.com/track/5g1vtHqi9uV7xtYeCcFOBx?si=mwxBWkuFQv-VOJmQnwBnUA)\n\nDespite all odds, The College Dropout got played. A lot. Enough to get two top 10 singles, and most importantly - enough to start a massive shift in hip hop trends that left a permanent mark in the history of the genre.\n\nThe wind of change was rising, growing even stronger with the release of Kanye's second album. People were missing music they could relate to, and Ye's message of believing in yourself was resonating with them more than songs about somebody's new Bentley:\n\n*\"Last week I paid a visit to the institute, They got the dropout keepin' kids in the school\".*\n\n* [Champion (recommended listening #2)](https://open.spotify.com/track/6AH2mrJAb42ZqUpeV8VOZP?si=xQUj5QSASwaeae1mkT4yLA)\n\nKanye became the people's favorite underdog, by rapping with his jaw wired shut because of a car accident, or giving his famous \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\" statement without warning on live national television, in response to the government's poor response to hurricane Katrina.\n\nRappers with similar themes in their music started getting more attention, as record companies were giving more exposure to soul sample hip-hop with self-aware rhymes, which had been confined to the underground ever since it went out of fashion in the 90s.\n\nThe tide was shifting, the divide between gangster rap and the \"new kids\" growing more and more narrow, culminating several years later in the famous album sale battle between Kanye and 50 Cent's albums \"Graduation\" and \"Curtis\". Before the albums dropped, 50 even jokingly claimed he wouldn't release any more music if Kanye West could outsell him. Ye's album outsold his in a unimaginable 1 million to 650 thousand copies sold. The conclusion was clear: the era of gangster rap's chart hegemony was over, and you can guess who had the biggest influence on this revolution.\n\n**Chapter 3. \"The New Kanye\"**\n\nNow for a bit of an explanation. When people talk about Kanye West's discography, it's usually divided into \"old Kanye\" and \"new Kanye\" eras. People love comparing them. So much so that in his 2016 album \"The Life of Pablo\", Ye included a tongue-in-cheek confused reaction interlude track called \"I Love Kanye\". It goes on about how \"I love the Old Kanye and hate the New Kanye\" - funny, if you'd want to listen to it.\n\nWhile it's not a very clear distinction, and one that a lot of people including myself don't find to be that importnant, it mainly draws a line between his aforementined Graduation trilogy, and everything after that.\n\nThe after part is maybe even more interesting to discuss, because here Ye's carreer takes a turn from a sympathetic story of a hip-hop saviour into more of a grey area, and one that most people are familiar with. That's where Ye starts venturing into the more experimental sides of music, as well as breaking into the fashion world with varying success. Despite all that, one thing stays permanent - he continues on his journey to grow into one of the most influential artists of his time.\n\n**\"808s and Hearbreak\"**\n\nThe first chapter that defined this new era started with Kanye's life taking a tragic turn. His mother Donda West, who had been one of the most important people in his life, passed away due to post-surgery complications. This event shook him to the core, and since the plastic surgery that his mother underwent was strongly encouraged by him, it left him with an immense feeling of guilt.\n\n[\"Hey Mama\" (recommended listening #3)](https://open.spotify.com/track/46OFHBw45fNi7QNjSetITR?si=r1wlER1zTy6QWBbKl3gvng) - the song he wrote to his mother released in 2005. After her death, he broke down in tears in concert trying to perform it.\n\nShortly after, his fianc\u00e9e and partner of six years ended their relationship, leading Kanye even deeper into the abyss of sorrow and regret.\n\nNaturally, his next album \"808s and Heartbreak\" reflected that. It sounded nothing like anything he's done before, and nothing like what the industry and the listeners were expecting: the album was made up of auto-tune singing over somber and minimalistic beats and melodies, exploring the themes of loss, sadness and loneliness in ways that left many listeners confused.\n\nLooking back at it, however, its influence on the landscape of popular music and hip-hop as a whole ended up being bigger than anyone could imagine. Along with Kid Cudi, with whom he closely collaborated both on 808s and on Cudi's own equally influential debut album \"Man on the Moon\", Ye launched a new wave in modern hip hop.\n\nThe use of auto-tune singing and the exploration of deeply personal themes has become the new trend, the waves of which can still be felt in the hip-hop scene today through modern hip hop's biggest artists, be it trap music stars like Travis Scott and Future or new school rappers like Lil Uzi Vert and Lil Peep.\n\n[Heartless (recommended listening #4)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4EWCNWgDS8707fNSZ1oaA5?si=cM0PBw-VTsC8AJyWiNhteg) - referring to this style, Kanye has once tweeted, \"first of all, me and Cudi invented this shit\", which is a true fact (tm)\n\n**\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\"**\n\nBy 2009, he had been at the forefront of so many movements and styles that helped redefine the genre that he was seen as a sort of Miles Davis of hip-hop. \"Kanye West\" had become a household name, and with that success came fame. With that fame came scrutiny and criticism, especially of all his public fuck-ups.\n\nThe infamous Taylor Swift incident, where a drunk Ye interrupted Swift's award acceptance, had ruined in minutes the reputation he'd been building up for years. That reputation, not without reason, was beginning its transition to the \"shallow loudmouth\" area that so many people are familiar with.\n\nThat wasn't the most pleasant experience, and it led Kanye to question and explore the dark sides of fame and success. In that quest (a Kanye Quest?), he spent more than two years working hard to produce a new album involving dozens of talented musicians. An album that would come to be considered not only his greatest, but one of the greatest of the 21st century, cementing his place as one of hip-hop's greatest. The album also led to a sort of redemption for Kanye's reputation. There was no questioning that he still got it.\n\n[\"All of the Lights\" (recommended listening #5)](https://open.spotify.com/track/22L7bfCiAkJo5xGSQgmiIO?si=-vqA5ZhqTnmC5S3YZdTtQw) - hit single Kanye in all his glory\n\nThe ambition behind the project required Ye to act more as an orchestra leader than player, bringing together artists from Elton John, John Legend and Bon Iver to Jay Z and Pusha T. This monumental effort led to equally monumental outcomes, creating an unprecedented type of rap record. It was the portrait of popular music of that time, combining so many things that it left people mind-blown.\n\nAt this point I have to mention that despite all that, strangely enough, it's my least favorite Ye album. However, it is quite a rare opinion, especially for a big fan of his music, so I can't say I don't recommend listening to it. A lot of people like it a lot, so you might as well.\n\n**\"Yeezus\"**\n\nBefore we go on to Kanye's next album, I have to re-iterate that despite being a huge fan, or maybe because of that, there are lots of things about him that I am very critical of. His well documented narcissism, at times bordering on God complex, is certainly one of them. However, I also have to make the distinction that I am critical of it as an influence of someone's well-being. In terms of creativity, this very same trait has led to some of the most interesting work in Kanye's discography.\n\nThis next album, Yeezus, reaffirmed Kanye's status as an egomaniac in the public eye with lines such as \"You see it\u2019s leaders and it\u2019s followers, but I\u2019d rather be a dick than a swallower\" and \"I am a God\", from the humbly titled \"I am a God (feat. God)\".\n\nMore importantly though, it also continued to push the boundaries of his creativity. He employed experimental production inspired by underground hardcore hip-hop, that sounded nothing like any of his previous material, or any music in the charts for that matter. It was abrasive, filled with fast-paced distorted beats and lines overflowing with ego - in a way, the musical equivalent to a manic episode.\n\n[\"New Slaves\" (recommended listening #6)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4cAgkb0ifwn0FSHGXnr4F6?si=-LKdXXzcSxipTQV8JlUx9g) - at this point, it feels funny to say \"revolutionary\" about the third album in a row, you know? Song is about the prison system being a new form of slavery - *\"400 years later we buying our own chains\"*.\n\nWith this album also evolved his approach to the elements surrounding the music, which received as much thought and attention as the material itself. He announced the album by projecting a video for his new song on 66 buildings worldwide. The live shows for the album were elevated from regular \"guy on stage\" concerts to Bjork-level conceptual multi-act live shows with mind-blowing light shows, and Kanye on stage rapping through a futuristic custom face mask designed by a Belgian high fashion house. From then on, Kanye's shows have never returned to usual, evolving through iterations of strange ideas like floating platforms constantly moving above the crowd instead of a stage.\n\n**Chapter 3. The New New Kanye? + afterword**\n\n**\"The Life of Pablo\"**\n\n[Ultralight Beam (recommended listening #7)](https://open.spotify.com/track/1eQBEelI2NCy7AUTerX0KS?si=zdHmQXb6St-Cqtpz_Bqg1Q). Kanye doesn't even have a verse on this song, yet it is considered by many to be his magnum opus. Goes to show how Kanye is much more of a director than the actor sometimes. Another thing to note about the track is that in his guest verse, young Chicago rapper Chance the Rapper says \"I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail\" at one point. This really illustrates the reverence with which new generations of rappers view Ye.\n\nKanye's next album took three years. \"The Life of Pablo\", referring to three Pablos that inspired Kanye in a significant capacity - Picasso, Escobar, and Saint Paul, focused on Kanye's choice of his family over a rockstar lifestyle and the temptations of the latter. That was done through songs like \"FML\", abbreviating both \"for my lady\" and \"fuck my life up\", and the cover depicting pictures of a church-going family and a woman in a bikini contrasted by the repeated words \"WHICH / ONE?\"\n\nThe focus of the album relied on such heavy topics as uncertainty of real affection, questioning friendships and intentions with lines mentioning *\"Money turn your kin into an enemy\"* and *\"Real friends - how many of us? How many jealous? Trust issues...\".*\n\n[\"FML\"](https://open.spotify.com/track/30Zcjs7pgEkmJA1lEbGSWT?si=ZwEsJxzPTxuNZSpRykGmjA) + [\"Real Friends\"](https://open.spotify.com/track/66Q3fAmSX5eHamgbKa9alP?si=Ys_hlN6JRNiGn90XVptvrg) (recommended listening #8) - two consecutive low key songs on the album, talking about how Ye wants his kids *\"to have an easy life, not like Yeezy's life\"*. Interestingly enough, for such a huge rap artist known for a loud mouth, you can see just how so many of the songs are not upbeat or really superficially braggadocios. Partly because of my selection, but partly because Kanye as an artist shines in a lot of different lights.\n\nThe album was extremely ambitious and conceptual, reaching success most artists wouldn't dream of, yet somehow it couldn't compare to Kanye's previous work in terms of cultural impact or sales, leaving him feeling like his popularity and relevance have faded. II guess when you get used to every album of yours being a revolution in the industry, just a critically acclaimed hit album feels like a failure.\n\n**\"ye\", \"Kids See Ghosts\" and the future**\n\nThat feeling of failure, among other things, led Kanye to almost entirely isolate himself from society and focus on his family, moving to Wyoming for several years to deal with personal issues and mental health.\n\nDuring that time he made no public statements, and worked purely on making music, producing several 7-song albums for artists on his label, as well his own album \"ye\" and a collaborative album with long-time collaborator and friend Kid Cudi, titled \"Kids See Ghosts\".\n\n\"ye\" was almost like a depressive episode counterpart to the manic Yeezus - an album of seven low-key introspective songs depicting a deeply troubled man. It talked about struggling against many mental issues, and trying to fully stop medicating, motivated by a fear of overdose - the thing that took the lives of some of his biggest inspirations, Micheal Jackson and Prince.\n\n[\"Violent Crimes\" (recommended listening #9)](https://open.spotify.com/track/3s7MCdXyWmwjdcWh7GWXas?si=7J8JH_fMReuZQamxtmwW_Q)\n\n\"Kids See Ghosts\", on the other hand, focused on the feeling of overcoming those issues, of getting over the pain and the fear, finding strength and love, feeling complete again - a theme very important to both Kanye and Cudi, who himself had gone through a particularly rough period, and has struggled with depression his whole life.\n\n[\"Reborn\" (recommended listening #10).](https://open.spotify.com/track/4RVbK6cV0VqWdpCDcx3hiT?si=7SKmbVMeSK-i4Yug8Q-SSg)\n\nThis turbulent time has also birthed Kanye's controversial Trump support statements, which destroyed his image in an unprecedented way. His line from \"Can't Tell me Nothing\", *\"I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny, and what do I do? Act more stupidly\"* seem prophetic in retrospect.\n\nThis time Ye fell not only in the public eye, but also in the eyes of his family and friends, most of who went from trying to understand his stance and urging people to try to do the same, to eventually seeing it as the mix of mental issues and simple ignorance that it was. Ironically, it was Kanye himself this time who everyone felt like \"doesn't care about black people\".\n\nSince then he has hasn't really taken those statements back, but he did eventually promise to stop making political statements and focus on music. If it turns out to be true, it might even lead to us enjoy more new material from one of the most curious artists of this generation. That is what I am hoping for, at least.\n\nI am also hoping that you enjoyed reading this little guide, and learned something new and interesting. Maybe it changed your mind, maybe it didn't - hopefully it was an interesting story regardless.Let me know what you thought of it, and have a nice day :)\n\nedit: yooo didn't expect so much attention and positive feedback, thanks y'all!! \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\n\nedit 2: o shit, got gold too wtfff, thanks so much! amazing start of the week",

The second release date (11/23) was announced two months in advance, and Adidas changed their Yeezy 350 v2 Seseme release date to coincide with that (perhaps to boost sales?). We know the album is almost completely finished (confirmed by bongo) and its very conceivable that Kanye wants a normal rollout. The first color of the Yeezy boost 700 V2 was just announced for 12/29 ([https://twitter.com/theyeezymafia/status/1069335787953516544](https://twitter.com/theyeezymafia/status/1069335787953516544)) which is a shoe Kim and Kanye have worn a ton, but this release date is out of the blue. There was no inkling that this model was even releasing anytime soon before today. With Kanye's tendency to drop around New Years, the fact that the album is confirmed to be almost finished, and the fact that he was just visiting murakami (frequent collaborator), I think its possible that the release date is going to be 12/28-12/29.

Maybe. But this all seems to line up too well for it to not be at least somewhat planned. As to why he went back to 15 with TLOP, idk. Maybe he decided to restart after a decade, maybe it had something to do with the \u201cOld Kanye\u201d theme of the album. Whatever the case, if this trend keeps up, then it seems like Yandhi will have 13 songs. I\u2019d be pretty satisfied with that",

Based on the snippets we\u2019ve heard, it seems like it will be a very uplifting and socially conscious record. Now if Yandhi is a sequel to Yeezus, which it most likely is, this presents some interesting possibilities for Yandhi\u2019s narrative. Yeezus is one of Kanye\u2019s most narrative driven and conceptual albums, telling the story of a man who experiences anger and frustration with the world, attempts to drown his sorrow in his ego and a fast lifestyle, and eventually realized that the only way to true happiness is through love. However, by the end of the story (which is Bound 2) he is still kind of a jerk. Therefore I think that Yandhi will follow the same character as he uses his newfound knowledge and happiness to continue to improve himself, as well as the rest of the world with which he was once so frustrated, bringing the narrative full circle.",

Maybe they just put the actual album on the back-burner until things had cooled down politically.

      "selftext": "Alright so hear me out cause this is going to be a long winded post, but this is why I believe Yandhi might be the greatest album of all time. I'll rap up my post at the end but the overall idea is that Yandhi is taking the best parts from all other Ye albums. Obivously the most obvious element is from Yeezus, \nthe album artwork and initial impression feeding into ideas of uniqueness that makes the album stand out from Ye's other albums in terms of style, which I fully expect  Yandhi to follow. Now if we look at Ye's earlier albums, we can also see juxtapostition with his earlier modus operandi of building off of previous works, while also adjusting his motifs and instrumentals enough to give proceeding works their own sense of identity, as we \ncan see with the albums Late Registration and Graduation. Now looking to my personal two favorite Ye \nalbums, MBDTF and College Dropout, what I think makes these albums stand out as powerhouses \nis Ye deciding to change the game. While Ye's other albums have paved the way for new ideas and styles,\nthese two albums are almost dedicated to addressing how much potential there is for music that \nbreaks free from the status quo. What could be the double-edge sword of the album is an opinion that I \nhad formed after listening to TLOP and other recent tracks, which is that Ye will always rap on the level \nof the features in the song. While this works out well in cases like No More Parties In LA, we'll see \nhow this plays out in Yandhi with the features we've learned about so far. Now if we look at 808s and Ye, \nthese two albums emotional energy served to create some outstanding works, while 808s also served as \nan almost therapeutic outlet for Ye that then allowed him to take that emotion and transform it into a \npassionate energy in MBDTF and Yeezus. As Ye has said in interviews that Ye was the album of him working \nthrough his mental turmoil, I am confident that Yandhi will have that charged up energy that comes from \nYe when he has been able to clear his mind.\n\n\n\nNow as you may have figured out by now there is a common idea from all these works that I've mentioned, \nand it is this one idea that above everything else gives Yandhi the most potential to be the greatest \nalbum of all time. That idea is that it is a mother fucking Ye album and any Ye album is going to be the \ngreatest album ever made.",

With Kanye being bipolar is confirmed, that allows us to look back on previous works in a different light. TLOP is clearly bipolar, what with it being erratic, such as it going from preachy like ultralight  and pt1, then bangers like famous and the glitchy feedback. We even have the most telling light on feedback, \"I've been outta my mind, a long time 4x.\" That brings us to Facts (Charlie heat version). This song is so random, it's hard to call it coherent. As watching the throne podcast stated \"we go 10 lines without a line about Nike, on a diss song about nike\". We have random streetfighter samples, lines about random shit kanye bought, a line about Bill Cosby that makes no sense, and a jumpy beat.\nWe go \"look at nike, working off the backs of these poor workers who are worked like slave labour\" to !!!COUCHES COUCHES COUCHES WHICH ONE SHOULD I PICK?\nThe beat shifts nearly as much as the topics do. Near the end we even forget entirely about nike and talk about Timbuck2s death. Going back to ye, we see on tracks like yikes the same thing happens. We go from talking about the news to hospital bands and his friends turning against him. The same erratic behaviour exists on both tracks in terms of flow, delivery, and even beat. Listen to the starting beat of facts (Charlie heat version) and then yikes, yikes sounds like a speed up version with a sample laid on top, but I dont know if that's just me. Yikes even even ends in a shriek that is placed nearly exactly where the (PERFECT) street fighter sample is put. It's to the point where I even dare say that Charlie heat did better than Yikes at showing this erraxrid bipolar behavior, mostly cuz Facts (Charlie Heat version)is real.",

SEND YOUR SUBMISSIONS IF YOU'RE ANY OF THE FIRST TWO, HIT ME UP ON EMAIL IF YOU CAN WORK AS ANY OF THE OTHER TWO ROLES (PLEASE DONT BAMBOOZLE, WE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT)**\n\n*Edit: just because someone called it dibs on a vocal, doesn't mean you can't submit that portion, and just because you call dibs, doesn't mean it will be necessarily in the album, what's going in there is the first stuff to arrive. It entirely depends on you to submit, but we're not gonna stop anyone from submitting to something. The more the better, right?*\n\n*Edit 2: thanks for the gold! and silver! also thanks for the sticky! i swear no bamboozle this time, just keep me stickied and we'll be done with this sooner than you can imagine. as for now, stuff is going very good, we advice all producers and mixers to join* [*https://discord.gg/NyFE2JG*](https://discord.gg/NyFE2JG) *to talk about the project. Also, we uncrossed out some dibs cause we really just want people to know what we have, if you called dibs you'll probably be in it, but its not completely clear until we're in the mixing stage of most of the songs. also, we really need vocals for all of the lights, so if you can do that, that'd be great! We'll talk later!*\n\n(Credit goes to u/couch-lock, u/wheretogo_whattodo and me for helping continue this idea btw)\n\nHello r/kanye.

However, the access to mix and stitch any track will be granted once the instrumental and all of the verses are put in the drive folder they belong in; If you drop bars, you will be featured, and if you made a beat, then you will be in the production section of the name (i.e: Lost In The World (feat. u/kanyeslut, u/HAAN, etc.) (prod. u/yeezusjustroseagain)), and all the features will be ordered by when they first appear on the track, first to last.\n\nI have a dream: If we get together to drop this on Nov. 22, we will be able to feed ourselves on MBDTF's 8th anniversary and the day before YANDHI drops. Can we do it, r/kanye?",

I had it in my mind that I didn\u2019t like Drake; I watched the video and he not only has valid reasons to be extremely pissed at Kanye, but he\u2019s also very articulate. He stays on topic and makes valid points! I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve seen Kanye speak for that long without changing topics 20 times, referencing dragon energy, illustrating his basic misunderstanding of history, slavery, etc., and generally making himself look like a dumbass.\n\nI\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Kanye is one of the greatest musical artists of the last 20 years based on what he\u2019s already released, if not *the* best. He\u2019s also now lost his grasp on reality and is in a downward spiral. When he announced Yandhi I told every other Kanye fan I know that I kinda felt like it wasn\u2019t real, and of course it wasn\u2019t. Instead he pushed it back by months.\n\nHow do most of you not care that he went on SNL dressed as a water bottle, did a song with the shittiest \u201crapper\u201d in the world, wore a MAGA hat while going on a rambling rant, and then didn\u2019t release his album? I watched the video today of Kanye working on the drums for Stronger in the studio with Timbaland. Jay-Z\u2019s in the clip as well, talking with Kanye. That Kanye was like a different person. There\u2019s a reason Drake and Jay-Z hate this guy, and it\u2019s his own fault.  \n\nWake up.\n\n\n",

Over the years my interest in him started to stray. And a lot of it first came from how he acted as a person outside of music. \n\nWhen it first came out, I didn't care for MBDTF. \n\nThen, Yeezus came out and my roommate was a huge Kanye fan, and showed it to me and I loved it. I was hooked on Kanye again. \n\nThen, all the drama around TLAP happened and I wasn't even interested in it. Never even wanted to listen because of the bad taste in my mouth so I didn't. Didn't even give it a full shot until after KIDS SEE GHOSTS. \n\nSo, with the drama that came with him losing his mind, asking Jay Z not to kill him I thought he was done. \n\nThen he had a rebirth but also drama filled intro to Ye, but I liked Ye. Then he helped produce 4 other amazing albums including his own team up with Kid Cudi who I love. \n\nSo I was on a Kanye high this year, still knowing he wasn't a person I agreed with on real life topics, but loved his music and production. \n\nWhen Yandhi was announced I about came my pants. When it didn't come out and he went on another drama trip, including endorsing Trump even more, turned me off. \n\nNow me, I'm not a political person, I don't like the left or the right and believe our government is fucking all of us. But I definitely don't view trump as any kind of respectable leader nor anyone anybody should get behind. \n\nTo be honest, Kanye endorsing any politician turns me off given his past lyrics and where he came from. But Trump?\n\nTo me, this is the biggest let down I have had from Kanye and the more I see him trying to gain the political attention and appreciation from Trump and the right makes me sick. I would feel the same if it was a left president. \n\nI just don't get what he's doing and I am becoming less and less interested in Yandhi as the days go on. \n\nI just would love to hear this subs opinion on what the hell Ye is doing and do you agree with the president Trump is and everything he stands for? I'm not asking for your political side, IMO the left is just as corrupt as the right and fuck pur government. But I don't want my good artist siding with these assholes. \n\nBtw: after Ye I have MBDTF a listen and I loved it. ",

And yes I know he's done some really stupid shit during this, but surely this is better than having a constant negative rhetoric pushed by the media every. single. day. \n\nAnd in regards to Yandhi the frustration for delaying the album is understandable. But c'mon he's already released 2 albums this year, he didn't have to release another one. If it improves the quality of the music I am 100% behind him.\n\nNo one deserves to have racial slurs and constantly have their mental health questioned just because they don't accept to play along with what society wants them to.\n\n",

I find the stuff Kim said about him on KUWTK a little concerning especially alongside everything that\u2019s happened. The Yandhi fiasco isn\u2019t a good look either, in my opinion it wasn\u2019t professional and it\u2019s insane he didn\u2019t make a statement.

I have never met him and almost certainly never will. There is no way for me to know how Kanye thinks or what his intentions are. If he wants to go and support Trump then more power to him. His political beliefs have no impact on my life or my thoughts on his music. However, in the social media age, everyone has a voice and many people are letting it be known that they do not condone his recent behavior. More power to those people. If they disagree with him then their voices deserve to be heard as well. I just hope that if Kanye is suffering from mental health issues, then hopefully he can conquer his demons and continue to inspire us with his music.\"\n\n[https://www.thesidelineobserver.com/articles/what-in-the-world-is-going-on-with-kanye](https://www.thesidelineobserver.com/articles/what-in-the-world-is-going-on-with-kanye)",

The only thing that lets this album down is how he didn't write Violent crimes, the darkest and most emotional song on the album. It taints it for me, and the fact he tweeted that while Yandhi was missing so no one would notice it disappointed me. I'm hyped for Yandhi, I think it has potential to be very, very good, but im worried for him, and im worried for his kids too with their dad acting like that all the time.

In relation to trump yes I do disagree with his use of social and political issues as a means of increasing interest in his roll out, however he's not wrong in my opionon with out love all you have is hatred and fear, the overall demographic of this sub reddit is people who at one point or another in there life had self confidence issues trouble dealing with social situations and are people who are creative's that is what it is to be a kanye fan, why don't we try to understand where the man is coming from not just on a purely superficial level but rather in a deeper way, I know our idol is acting out but that is not an excuse to pull at straws to the extent of relating everything to him having a full on episode because once again I believe in my opinion that this is the wrong thing to do, we should lead with love instead of hate, these are just my thoughts I like many of us have felt let down with the delay of Yandhi, but if we get the music I think we will I believe it will be worth it, Ye is still healing he's a human being who sometimes speaks before thinking which leads to miscommunication, he's a human being and at this point at any point he needs to feel our love for him, thank you everyone for your opinions and the superhero level quality memes that we have been getting, we got love. \n\nTLDR: HELL YEAH BROTHER CHEERS FROM IRAQ\n\n",

This just increases the doubt in my heart, with him going all around these places does he even remember he promised us an album, he didnt even announce its delay  himself, kim did. This is the same guy that would lock himself up for days on end perfecting his music, him going to record it in Africa sounds like something he came up with on the fly. Africas a continent not a country, does he even have a plan on which places his gonna visit of is he just gonna go where the winds takes him or something like that \n\nIm worried here guys, the guy is off his meds and im afraid they gonna be exploring and kanye gonna be like that one kid that cant contain his curiosity and gets lost a few seconds in.

I think that it has the setup to be a gamechanger, much like MBDTF. lemme explain why:\n\n-The Delay \nLet\u2019s face it. Kanye\u2019s recent albums have come across as a little more loose as of late. While still maintaining quality, TLOP came under a lot of criticism for its weak middle and rushed producing. Similarly, although on a less important note, many of the lyrics and concepts referred to on Ye were things that had happened literally WEEKS prior to the album releasing. The delay here gives Kanye more time to focus on the album\u2019s sound and lyrical content and hopefully will give him the capability to create a more consistent LP. \n\nNOTE: My criticism of \u2018Ye\u2019s lyricism is more of a personal preference than an outward flaw. Responding to real world events is generally a good idea for any rapper, however the rapid rate in which Kanye incorporated these things into the album makes me wonder about how much of it was done.\n\n-This Years Discography\n\nRegardless of your thoughts about Kanye\u2019s work this year, very few would consider it disappointing. Ye provides us with an accurate depiction of Kanye\u2019s mental state and contains a number of excellent tracks. Similarly KIDS SEE GHOSTS has proven to be an incredible album with excellent production and lyricism.  So far this year has been excellent for Kanye musically and it is likely this trend will continue \n\n\n-The TMZ interview \n\nMajority of people who\u2019ve watched the TMZ interview will likely be worried. For me it\u2019s quite the opposite.  There are a number of things Kanye said in that video which got me excited.\n\n1.  He openly acknowledged that some of the fans don\u2019t think he\u2019s dropped anything as good as MBDTF or Watch the Throne since they were released. He then goes on to claim that he wants to release something better. \n\n2. The ego is back. And bigger than ever. There\u2019s a reason this ones gonna be a sequel to Yeezus folks \n\n3. He\u2019s going to Africa to record it. When he went to Hawaii we got a masterpiece. Let\u2019s see what we get now.\n\nOverall, apart from the typical Kanye craziness, everything seems to suggest that this next album could be incredible. Alternatively, it could fail drastically and maybe Kanye has dragged himself into a whole he can\u2019t get out of. However, i have faith. I know he acts the fool but he is still supremely talented and has proven that this year.",

He doesn't even owe us an apology to be honest.\n\nHe announced an album and then seemingly forgot about it. Yes, that's bad. A lot of people are upset about it. Not to mention the tweets of actual nonsense.\n\nBut he's a perfectionist stretching himself very thin right now. He has mental health issues. So he planned for Yandhi to be done, and the time came, and it's just not. He's been so busy doing shit he didn't do it on schedule. We've all been in high school. We've all not done shit on deadline.\n\nSo why didn't he say anything? Why did Kim have to tell us?\n\nBecause he's ashamed. He feels like he failed his fans on this. He feels like he failed himself. It's hard to talk about, especially when he feels like a superhero. Admitting you fucked up, you made a bad album so far, and admitting it publically, it's not easy.\n\nI fuck up at my job sometimes, and I cost my company tens of thousands of dollars, in one night. You have no idea how hard that is to admit. If I could have my wife tell my boss, I would too.\n\nYes, this is his fault for not meeting deadlines and stretching himself so thin.

      "selftext": "I just want to get this out there. With all this hype around Yandhi it's got me pretty worked up. Back in 2016 when TLOP was released I was abusing stimulants. On first hearing the album and the lines in Ultralight Beams I was mystified and entranced by the lyrics \"This is a God dream, this is everything\". I thought, and still believe, Kanye doesn't say anything for no reason (although the reasons may be complicated or perhaps mundane). I can't imagine living inside the head of another person, let alone Kanye, but when someone with as much passion as Ye (Jesus Walks) says \"This is a God dream, this is everything\", well I didn't take it lightly. Thus, TLOP became the medium in which I began mentally dissecting the feelings and words throughout the album trying to not only find but *understand* and truly feel whatever message Ye so passionately wants to convey. Maybe Ye is just talking to the universe, but for me at that time in my life it was an urgent broadcast. I thought, this is a call to action. What does Kanye need us to do? What can I do for Kanye? Long story short, I came to the conclusion that Kanye was trusted with inside knowledge from the government that an alien species had detected our presence due to waves emitted by DeepMind and was en route (years) to destroy us. Kanye had been selected and volunteered to lead the doomed Earth resistance and would be selected as president of the US in 2020 by the secret global consensus of the highest leaders. Meanwhile, the secret consensus would gather the \"top genetic\" people and usher them to a new home outside the solar system while Ye and the rest of Earth would nobly stay behind to face the inevitable for the ultimate survival of the human race. My mission, as selected and volunteered, and as mourned in Saint Pablo, would be to fly a dummy cargo ship tangent and opposite to earth and the real convoy's trajectory, to lure the hostile force towards me, at which point I would sacrifice myself. \n\nThis was the realest thing I've ever felt and I was ready to sacrifice myself. After a couple stays in various treatment centers over the past few years I feel I've overcome my bout of psychosis, have stopped using stimulants and other drugs except weed, and feel stable and in touch with reality. However, this is still the realest thing I've ever experienced and I felt close with someone that I've admired ever since I was in middle school listening to college dropout on the bus to feel strength against adversity.\n\nI wish Kanye the best and I miss him, even though none of it was real.\n\nI'm open to questions if anyone is interested in hearing more. I feel comfortable talking about it and I think it will help me process the anxiety I am currently feeling around the Yandhi release.\n\nThank you Reddit for listening!\n\nEdit: Some proof: \nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/Dsp1CTe\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/UWT3ydi\n\nA letter I wrote to myself in in-patient:\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/YdBc2NM",

I feel that it\u2019s gonna be the same thing with Yandhi, there was a 2 month gap between the infamous TMZ episode and the release of Ye. I feel that\u2019s why it\u2019s being pushed back 2 months. This TMZ episode is going to controversial AS FUCK. Why? To get Kanye more talked about through the best way possible \u2014 Controversy.\n\nMight be a reach but I noticed something ab it.\n\nEDIT: Why the fuck am I getting Downvoted? ",

To which one of them pointed out some of Kanye's arguments revolving around slavery and/or Donald Trump. So, take that in for a quick moment. We have white dudes out here saying it's okay because a black guy said it. Which I know isn't the case in the slightest - you all know that. Everyone with an ounce of intelligence knows that, but then there's the majority that doesn't. The people who were already borderline white supremacists, the people that supported the shit Trump preached, etc. \n\nKanye isn't a stable individual. I'm sorry but he's just not. He hasn't been since his mom died. \"Oh but he has a family now and a loving wife.\" You're out of your damn mind if you think Kim has an ounce of stability after everything she's been through as well. \n\nI love Kanye, man. I'll always love his music, and I'll always thank him for getting me through what he did. However even if this IS just marketing and means of stirring controversy for his own publicity/brand - then i'm fucking sick of it because it's not necessarily doing his fans any favours. Not to mention the fact that Yandhi didn't even come out on time. I mean, that's fairly entitled of us to want that but if he can't keep a simple promise then what makes you think he's seriously some dude on another level with some \"next-level\" opinion? \n\nTake care y'all. \n\n",

[https://charlesmonteverdi.tumblr.com/](https://charlesmonteverdi.tumblr.com/)\n\nHis IG also says 9.29.2018\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 3:\n\n[This is a link to the gif from his site](https://pro2-bar-s3-cdn-cf.myportfolio.com/9927dfebdc8e47f300fa1ef6be2a94c7/186f064e-065e-4517-bfea-f2d485978fb4.gif?h=be70136190485a78d3c0dcdb8a741a27)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 4:\n\n[Kim K tweeted the album will be out November 23rd](https://twitter.com/KimKardashian/status/1046823758709678081) so this was likely just this artist trying to promote himself. Nonetheless, this was pretty cool and I am going to continue trying to find the URL because this is fun.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 5:\n\n[A reddit user DMd Ryder](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/9kjzsg/yandhicom_conspiracy_is_false/) and he confirmed this owner is just playing games. It was still fun while it lasted, and this would have been a really cool way to rollout an album.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFuck you Kanye, first and foremost, for making me do this shit, had to get the whole reddit on this mothafucking website. Now we wait until November 23rd :/",

      "selftext": "9 29 18\n\nWe all thought this was a date. It's not. It's a code and must be treated as such. Over the last 30 hours I've been doing an in-depth analysis in order to break the code and reveal the meaning behind the message. \n\nAfter spending too long trying to decipher the code behind the numbers I began looking for different routes to decipher the meaning. When all possibilities are equal, the simplest explanation has a high tendency to be the correct one, but that's not always the case. This is not a date, combination, or set of numbers. The numbers actually represent letters. \n\nThe letters correspond to the numeric value of the letters of the English language. 92918, or alphabetically, I-B-I-A-H. After diving in to potential meanings I have landed on this:\n\nIntergalactic\n\nBrotherhood\n\nInterstellar\n\nAstronomical\n\nHarmonizers\n\nIBIAH is short for the Intergalactic Brotherhood of Interstellar and Astronomical Harmonizers. \n\nBut it goes beyond that. 92918 requires a summation to reach 56. [Messier 56](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messier_56) is a globular cluster in the constellation Lyra. From this one can surmise, that the Brotherhood meets in the constellation of Lyra.\n\nYou might be thinking, okay that is pretty cool, but wait there's more. [In\u00a0Greek mythology, Lyra represents the\u00a0lyre\u00a0of\u00a0Orpheus. Made by\u00a0Hermes\u00a0from a\u00a0tortoise shell, given to\u00a0Apollo\u00a0as a bargain, it was said to be the first lyre ever produced. Orpheus's music was said to be so great that even inanimate objects such as\u00a0trees,\u00a0streams, and\u00a0rocks\u00a0could be charmed. Joining\u00a0Jason\u00a0and the\u00a0Argonauts, his music was able to quell the voices of the dangerous\u00a0Sirens, who sang tempting songs to the Argonauts.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyra). \n\nI think it's pretty obvious that the above description also can be applied directly to Kanye. \n\nDuring more in-depth analysis, I realized Messier 56 was discovered in 1779. What historical event took place in 1779 that may be connected? 1779 just so happens to be the year [Jean Baptiste Pointe\u00a0Du Sable established the first Non-Indigenous settlement of chicago](https://worldhistoryproject.org/1779/jean-baptiste-pointe-du-sable-establishes-first-non-indigenous-settlement-of-chicago). You know who else is a Non-Indigenous settler of Chicago. That's right, Kanye Omari West.\n\nFrom all of the above information I believe we can draw some conclusions. First and foremost, the album has been delayed because Kanye is working to perfect the album with the IBIAH, the Intergalactic Brotherhood of Interstellar and Astronomical Harmonizers. Due to the vast distances of space, the final copy of Yandhi was delayed because communication took slightly longer then expected. Yandhi will also contain a connection to Earth and nature through the charming of inanimate objects, similar to Orpheus. So the album will represent inspiration for the future and the past, space travel, nature, and a throwback to Kanye's roots in Chicago.\n\nIt was all so obvious all along. We were just looking at it wrong. Yandhi will drop as soon as transmission is complete. God Speed Kanye West.",

Usually weeks-months before an album drops he pops up in the spotlight, does erratic controversial shit and then disappears after the release. Why should this be any different? Kanye makes a tweet about how he wants to be called Ye. Before you know it there are shitty articles that all read the same way. \"Kanye changes name to Ye before his SNL show\". Now while he is on SNL he wears his MAGA hat and does a small rant on politics. Now there are even more shitty headlines out the wazoo. All about kanye, the rant, and how he has an album coming out. \"Kanye goes on SNL with maga hat, you wont believe what he does at the end\". Then after that, somehow its magically leaked how many songs are on the album. Now were at shitty article overload. And THEN theres writing about how the album is supposed to be released and isn't out yet \"and fans are absolutely ____________\". All of this just adds up to publicity which will help drive sales. I really dont thi k it's anything deeper.\n\n\nBut goddamn I can't wait till it comes out.",

I let out a hearty \"hell yea!\", poured myself a nice cold O'Doul's non-alcoholic brew, turned up the surround sound, and clicked the link.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, the two main things I noticed immediately about YANDHI were 1.) it was MUCH shorter than I expected, only about 10 minutes in total, and 2.) it's a completely visual album, shot in pretty low resolution, which almost gives it the feel of an amateur video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I was excited by this new direction Kanye was taking, but I soon realized that there wasn't really any music to speak of in the video. In fact, around the 4 minute mark I really started to question if Kanye would ever get around to rapping, or if he'd just continue with the extremely raunchy shot of the lone actress (not sure of her name, looked a bit like Amy Schumer?) masturbating on the couch for the entire 10 minutes! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEventually Kanye did come on screen, but just as he was about to start his performance my wife came barging in, starting a fuss about the loud moaning coming from the speaker system. I tried to explain to her it that it was just the new Kanye West visual album, but apparently the symbolism of Kanye, (and now also Kid Cudi who'd just joined him on screen), forcefully making love to an overweight actress in nylon stockings was completely lost on her. Needless to say I finished the album in peace afterwards, as my wife took the kids to her parent's house for the night. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter the first listen I'd give YANDHI a 10/10, not because it was a great album, but because no piece of art has ever forced me to drop my pants and whip out the old trouser snake in the middle of my own living room before tonight, and if that's not the sign of a great album then I don't know what is.  \n\n ",

To which one of them pointed out some of Kanye's arguments revolving around slavery and/or Donald Trump. So, take that in for a quick moment. We have white dudes out here saying it's okay because a black guy said it. Which I know isn't the case in the slightest - you all know that. Everyone with an ounce of intelligence knows that, but then there's the majority that doesn't. The people who were already borderline white supremacists, the people that supported the shit Trump preached, etc.\n\nKanye isn't a stable individual. I'm sorry but he's just not. He hasn't been since his mom died. \"Oh but he has a family now and a loving wife.\" You're out of your damn mind if you think Kim has an ounce of stability after everything she's been through as well.\n\nI love Kanye, man. I'll always love his music, and I'll always thank him for getting me through what he did. However even if this IS just marketing and means of stirring controversy for his own publicity/brand - then i'm fucking sick of it because it's not necessarily doing his fans any favours. Not to mention the fact that Yandhi didn't even come out on time. I mean, that's fairly entitled of us to want that but if he can't keep a simple promise then what makes you think he's seriously some dude on another level with some \"next-level\" opinion?\n\nTake care y'all.\n\n\nI mean hell yeah brother cheers from Iraq",

Sure, it may sound nothing like Yeezus at all but then why not just name it Love Everyone as he had announced in April? The artwork and title, to me, indicate that there will be some sort of connection to Yeezus, whether it be sonically or through themes and ideas. Also, when was this album recorded? Is it from the Yeezus era? Was it the album originally recorded before TMZ? Or has it been in the works since after ye? What do you guys think?",

The album would make a bigger splash, he wouldn't be interfering with Wayne, and he'd have more time to fully flesh out the album. \n\nIf this is true, then Yandhi would ultimately end up being a better album. It'd be less rushed. He has time to add elements of recent controversies OR remove elements that could cause controversies, making it more topical either way. \n\nEither that or Rihanna is taking too long recording her fucking feature. \n\nEdit: Checked his twitter, he did talk to Lorne.

His tweets about some vague concept for the Yeezy brand, talking about the 13th amendment, talking about developing an operating system, it\u2019s just too much. If someone asked me what happens at Yeezy HQ everyday id have no fucking idea other than that everything is grey there for some reason.\n\nI was looking forward to Kanye returning to Chicago, chilling out, and dropping solid projects. So far we\u2019ve had him double down on the controversy in an even more erratic and unstructured way, and Yandhi hasn\u2019t even been mentioned in days. \n\nI\u2019ve always been the dude explaining Kanye to my friends and family and defending him, but I\u2019m really at a loss right now. Kanye seems to be trying to turn this whole Yeezy company into a big multi industry giant, but I have no idea what Kanye\u2019s goal are for his company outside of making erotic contortionist art and big slides. I love Kanye, and he\u2019s been the only artist I\u2019ve ever been able to truly relate to, but I\u2019m worried for him, and I feel he may be destroying his legacy even amongst his core fans.

      "selftext": "Kanye announced the release date for Yandhi before Wayne announced Carter V. Kanye realized that he would come second to the long anticipated album, but initially shrugged it off believing a #2 would be fine. With the album being rushed anyways, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he drops it\u2019s Friday to start a new week, go #1 and keep his streak of every solo album going #1 since Late Registration. Also it gives mike dean and crew another 6 days to polish it up. Just a theory but it seems logical. ",

I even rapped TLOP, Yeezus and MBDTF on soundcloud.\n\nYe was so disappointing. I was actually really excited when \u201cI Thought About Killing You\u201d started, it has an interesting beginning, but then he starts rapping \u201cI called up my loved ones, I called up my cousins, I called up the Muslims, said I\u2019m bout to go dumb\u201d \u201ctime to bring in the drums\u201d every line just sounds weightless and kind of lame. It honestly sounds like something Drake would make to me. (I don't think Drake is that bad, just not interesting at all. He can make some catchy stuff, but he's almost always rapping about coming from nothing or rapping about some girl.) Then there\u2019s the best switch, which is just an simple, average beat along with average lyrics. \n\nThat\u2019s the problem with pretty much every song on Ye for me. Boring beat, boring lyrics.   \nYikes has another average beat, boring lyrics, but I guess Kanye's delivery was alright.\nAll Mine has nothing special, didn't really like Ant Clemons at all. The way Ye says \u201cif I see you fuckin with the three stripes\u201d was funny, but that\u2019s it.  \nWouldn\u2019t Leave is ok, I like the background vocals and it gives the same nice vibe Bound 2 has and White Dress.\nI like No Mistakes, reminds me of older Kanye, something maybe between Late Registration and Graduation.   \nI really liked Ghost Town, but even at it\u2019s best it\u2019s just an alright Kanye song, it\u2019s not in a Yeezus or MBDTF tier, it sounds more like a Cruel Summer tier track. It\u2019s good, but Kanye can do so much better. I also think because of how it\u2019s one of the last songs, and because I was so disappointed at everything else, I only like it so much because everything else was so lackluster.  \nViolent Crimes is ok, but it doesn\u2019t even seem like it\u2019s Kanye\u2019s track with him being overshadowed by whoever the girl is singing.\n\n*TLDR* I had high expectations from Kanye because of how legendary his discography is and was very disappointed by this album. There\u2019s a few ok tracks, but that\u2019s it, they\u2019re just \u201cok\u201d. Ok beats, ok lyrics. I expected something great from Kanye. I thought \u201cI Love It\u201d was pretty funny, but it also worries me that Kanye will never make something at the level of MBDTF or Yeezus again, and I get it if he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t have anything to prove anymore and he\u2019s a father. [Just kind of sad.](https://i.imgur.com/sIuFgAz.jpg)   \n\nIs there anyone else feeling like this? Everyone seems to just love this album which confuses the hell out of me.\n\nI really hope Yandhi has some good shit. Wake up Mr. West!  ",

My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy brought Kanye back into the light. Yeezus came and gave us some more classics. The Life of Pablo taught us more about the inside of Kanye. A tough mental breakdown later and Ye comes out. The point is, weather Yandhi is real or not let's not forget 15 years of Kanye. 15 years of us listening and vibing to the growth of a legend and most importantly, ourselves. Our love for Kanye has become so commonplace that we forgot what it all really means. Listen to 'We Don't Care' and right after listen to 'Violent Crimes'. It's been a hell of a life to get to this moment. I'm proud to be here with you all. Someday this will all end. Let's be grateful we have it right now",

But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce myself. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was refreshing r/Kanye and left it refreshing to get myself a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to check the sub. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and low and behold, there's my phone and yandhi still hasnt been released.  \n ",

Yandhi will pick up where Ye stopped (Violent Crimes), it will show the ascension of Ye to Yahndi, by starting a peaceful revolution and entice the disciples (the future listeners) to do the same. This will start World Love 1, and a new \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a era. Stay tuned and be pacient.\n\nDon't believe it? Fine. Only people with 4th dimension perspective will understand.

Kids See Ghosts didn\u2019t come out until like noon the next day. Don\u2019t even get me started on Nasir (ESCOBAR SEASON!). The TT album was even more late, and now we\u2019re here: Yandhi.\n\nYe seems to always come out and cause some controversy before an album release. He interrupted Taylor Swift\u2019s acceptance speech months before MBDTF, and said crazy shit in radio interviews leading up to the release of Yeezus. There was the whole MAGA/TMZ appearance a few weeks before ye was released, and now we have the SNL rant proceeding the release of Yandhi. Kanye rides the momentum of controversy into huge album releases.\n\nI have seen how late releases get a lot of people talking about an album. Nasir got a lot of hype from a generation of hip-hop fans that I didn\u2019t even think knew of Nas. Reddit was going crazy that day with people saying \u201cWhen Nasir?\u201d\n\nKanye is my favorite artist of all time. Ye is also a certified troll, and I believe he is pulling out all of his tricks with this release. He tweeted a meme of himself photoshopped into a shot from Kim\u2019s infamous \u201cbreak the internet\u201d cover shoot. I think Kanye is doing his best to break the internet today. He was cut off during the rant on SNL last night, and now, where\u2019s Yandhi? Plenty of articles for the media to publish and get all the eyes on him before the big release \ud83d\udc41 \n\nI believe we are going to get Yandhi, but I believe Ye is trying to build momentum for this release by getting us all talking while we wait.\n\nAnyway, thanks for all the funny memes in the meantime.\n\n\n",

He tweeted a photo showing Adam Driver and \u201cYandhi\u201d as the guests on SNL around the same time that he tweeted the minidisc and the release date.\n\nWhat if he booked SNL and in a manic state decided it would be cool to put together a new album in two weeks, debut a couple songs on SNL, and release it that night? What if it was just a wild idea Kanye had that he couldn\u2019t live up to? That\u2019s why he performed I Love It, Ghost Town and an outtake from Teyana\u2019s album. That wasn\u2019t the original plan, I bet. I think he planned to debut new Yandhi songs, but he didn\u2019t finish the album in time and had nothing new to perform.\n\nI think Kanye and Mike Dean, and whoever else is working on this, are currently frantically trying to put together something resembling an album so Kanye can save face. They\u2019ll probably reuse a lot of songs we\u2019ve already heard. I Love It will be on there. That Teyana outtake will be on there. XTCY will probably be on there. It\u2019ll probably be another 7 track album, and they\u2019ll be pushing it to even get 7 tracks together.\n\nI just think Kanye bit off more than he could chew. He had a wild idea when he made the SNL booking, and it would have been epic if he pulled it off, but two weeks is a short amount of time to make a new album. I think we\u2019ll get something, eventually, called \u201cYandhi\u201d but it will be a lot of songs we\u2019ve already heard, probably a few outtakes from the Wyoming albums, and maybe a few actually new songs he\u2019s recorded since then.

With that out of the way I'm going to express some concerns I have about the upcoming album. First off is probably the worry most people have an that is the tekashi feature. I don't think I like a single one of his songs. His screaming is annoying and Fefe sounds like any other auto tune trap song. Unless Kanye pulls off a brilliant beat (I don't put it past him) that song is an instant skip. Next I don't like that this might turn into a mumbly trap album. The song \"80\" degrees or the one he posted on instagram sounded good until he started singing or more like mumble auto-tuning. Also with the feature of xxx and his recent song with Lil Pump you have to at least be a little afraid he might be  trying to clout chase. That really worry's me for this album. Coupled also with the tekashi feature and this album could be going in a direction I dont like. That being said I may be and hope I am wrong and this turns into another spectacular album under Kanyes belt. I don't know how this album will turn out but I will definitely listen to it as soon as it is available and hope for the best. ",

      "selftext": "**oh boi this is going to be long**\n\nI don't think anyone really cares about what my opinions or story is, but this is more of a post I'm making so I can look back in the future i guess :) \n\nThis was around the time The Story of Adidon dropped, and that was on the trending page of Youtube for a while. I didn't pay attention to it at first (wasn't really a hip hop fan back then), but after a few days of scrolling past it constantly, I decided to have a listen. Next thing I know, there's a bunch of Kanye songs on my recommended list. The first one I clicked was Ghost Town.  \n\n\nI clicked it as a joke because I honestly thought it would be trash, I wasn't into Kanye, or Hip Hop in general really. But when I listened to it, I found myself enjoying it a lot more and (for some reason) feeling guilty about it. I've heard of other Kanye songs throughout the years, but I was never really into it. I didn't find them bad or anything, I guess I didn't really pay attention. Anyways, one song led to the next, and I decided to properly give Ye a listen (on Spotify). Some of the songs were a miss at first (such as All Mine and ITAKY), and others I loved immediately (Wouldn't Leave, Ghost Town, No Mistakes). At this point I was pretty intrigued because woah, I'm enjoying Kanye West. I dug around on youtube watching album reviews of Ye, and one of the youtubers mentioned the fact that Kanye had \"legit classics under his belt\". And so my conquest into his discography began.  \n\n\n**Album Review(?)/Reaction(?) Summary**\n\nStarted off with the College Dropout, I didn't really pay attention to the lyrics back then, but the sound, and it was decent. I found myself enjoy a few tracks and absolutely forgetting some others... until Last Call came on. I listened to that carefully as I found myself engulfed in Kanye's storytelling. By the end of it, I had to replay the whole album because I clearly missed a lot. Loved it after the re-listen.  \n\n\nNext was Late Registration, which was a huge miss for me. I didn't understand the skits and why there were so many of them, and honestly decided to skip a lot of it. After listening to his other albums (and enjoying them a lot), I came back to this one. It was much easier and more enjoyable listening to this again after getting used to his music with his other albums.  \n\n\nGraduation was a straight hit to me, found myself enjoying every single track and it just made me feel good. (I knew the lyrics to Stronger as well so that made me feel pretty proud lol)\n\nNext was 808s, and this one hit me hard. I had some falling outs with a close friend around that time, and this album was a way of comfort. I found myself coming back to tracks like Coldest Winter and Street Lights. I also really enjoyed the sample in Robocop, very upbeat and makes me feel like I wanna run across a giant field.\n\nAt this point, I was doing a lot of research on Kanye, and of course, they all mentioned his magnum opus, MBDTF. I was pretty sceptical again, thinking it can't be *that* good... It was **that** good. The opening sounded grand and majestic, and almost every track that followed had amazing production. It was great sonically. However, I found myself not enjoying some tracks such as Blame Game, Devil in a New Dress (which I love now), So Appalled and Hell of a Life. It took a few re-listens to start appreciating those tracks. I thought Runaway was *way too long* at first, and that the last 3 minutes were a huge waste (boy was I wrong).\n\nCouldn't fully listen to Watch the Throne because its not on spotify REEEEE. I like No Church in the Wild a lot\n\nYeezus. Oof. I did **not** enjoy this at all first time. It sounded extremely different to everything (which I didn't mind), but it all sounded so noisy and distorted. I really didn't enjoy a lot of the lyrics (mainly because I couldn't hear them) so I found myself looking them up quite often. When I heard *I am a God*, it was like an *oof... okay so this is where all the* *\"recent\" media hate comes from.* And I can see why it could be portrayed that way.This is the album I come back to least, but I like it a lot more now. Some tracks are still very hard to get used to.\n\nTLOP was also a weird ride. Like Late Registration, I found myself not really listening to this properly, and just letting it play. It was a \"meh\" first experience, (other than the bleached asshole lyric. I found myself enjoying that line a lot more than I should have). This also took a few re-listens and it's probably my most replayed album now. It also has Cudi humming in waves which is just *heavenly*.  \n\n\n**Personal Thoughts on Kanye**\n\nI understand now why he has so many devoted fans. I watched his CTG interview and I realised how little I actually knew about Kanye. His way of thought was completely different to what I had in mind, and it just intrigued me even more on his character. I'm Australian so I don't pay too much attention to the whole MAGA hat thing (I honestly don't mind or care at all, but I understand how it can be viewed as a bad thing), but his reasoning of fighting against the tide and media really made me love him as a person. I also watched the TMZ interview and how a lot of what he said was missed or taken incorrectly (although to be fair, he also worded his words very poorly). The Kimmel interview with his analogy of coffee tables and trying love, the chicago radio interviews, and his tweets all made me see him in a different eye. I guess it taught me to separate the artist from the art itself. \n\nEver since I listened to Ye, I've been listening to a lot more music and hip hop in general. It made me realise that I shouldn't let reviews or media define how I view an artist or a music genre, but actually experience it for myself. And I'm glad I did. I found myself enjoying a lot of different artists like Cudi, Wayne (who I never thought I'd enjoy), Pusha, Jay, and a lot of new artists too, such as X.  \n(I'm kinda scared to admit this) but I also enjoy 6ix9ine a LOT. A LOT more than I ever thought I would. There's something about his songs that just give me adrenaline and make me hype, even if the lyrics are complete trash. I understand the sexual harrassment case surrounding 69 (and also X with the abuse), and I definitely do not support it. I watched his (69's) interview on the breakfast club where he tries to explain why it happened and everything regarding it, and I'm still very sceptical of the whole story. But I guess this is where the whole \"why not try love\" and separation of the art and the artist part comes in. \n\n**Yandhi**\n\nI guess this is the reason I'm making this whole post. I'm both excited and nervous about it, mainly because of the controversies surrounding it. I don't mind 69 and X, musically, so I'm not too worried about how they would sound on the album, because I know what to expect from them. Although I completely understand why a lot of people are hating the idea of having 6ix9ine in a Kanye album. Other recent controversies (such as Kanye embracing Bari and the 800 slaves comment) are extremely hard to swallow. I dislike the whole \"cancel\" culture but oof, this one ain't it. It kinda makes me guilty for enjoying his music, but I guess this is also where the artist should be separated from their music. Anyways, regardless of who features on this, I just hope it's able to connect with people and hopefully brings in new fans, like Ye did for me.",

As you all know, Nicki has a pretty popular song with 6ix9ine.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is, using the logic above, Weezy is also co-signing these individuals by having one on his album (X) and one who just did a song with 6ix9ine (Nicki).\n\nI\u2019m not saying I condone the actions of X or 6ix9ine, because I don\u2019t. However, I do believe everyone makes mistakes, even severe ones like these two have. But I also believe people do change. And at the end of the day, the past is the past and music is music. Kanye, as we all know, has been known to bring out the best in other artists. He loves everyone despite their flaws. It doesn\u2019t mean he loves what they\u2019ve done; He loves them as a human being. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to agree with this approach, but I think it\u2019s a beautiful way to live. \n\nI look forward to seeing how he incorporates these two into his album. \n\nWe get three Yeezy albums this year.

Literally no one cared when he prominently featured confederate flags in the Yeezus merch and design. Why? Because he was taking the meaning AWAY from those who use it for hate. He was reinterpreting the meaning of the flag for its BASE INTENTION of true freedom. \n\nnow I\u2019m not supporting the confederate flag or any racist behavior. That\u2019s just not me. What I\u2019m saying is that Kanye is using this hat in the same way he used the flag. Disassociate trump from the situation. Take the words for their base meaning. \u201cMake america great again.\u201d At his core, Kanye has ALWAYS been about positivity and unity. \n\nListen to his recent radio interview returning to Chicago and his actual in depth explanation of the hat. He doesn\u2019t \u201csupport\u201d trump. He doesn\u2019t support anyone. He supports the ideals of love and unity. he says he ~~voted ~~for trump because he knew trump would  ~~be the idiot he is and~~ ^(**EDIT: he never directly called trump an idiot. This was my opinion. Also, turns out Kanye never directly voted. I meant Endorsed. I believe his endorsement probably had more influence on the overall climate than a single vote would anyway, though**)overexpose information. he wanted change of any kind. He wanted people to see that the system is corrupt and exposed, and he wanted this to give people initiative to go out and make actual change next time. And in a way, it\u2019s worked. I\u2019ve never seen this much conversation about election and voter registration in my life. \n\nKanye is an artist in everything he does. Music, fashion, day to day life etc. This is no different. He\u2019s making a statement. He\u2019s here for the world. LOVE EVERYONE isn\u2019t just a marketing slogan for him and yeezy. he means it. \n\n#**LOVE EVERYONE**",

Most people assume, because it\u2019s named after Gandhi, that it will be about peace, nonviolence, love (basically the themes he might have explored on the project he abandoned earlier this year, Love Everyone). I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nYeezus had very little to do with the teachings of Jesus. It was more about Kanye having a God complex. He was only comparing himself to Jesus in the sense that he is a God. Now he\u2019s comparing himself to Gandhi, a great historical figure with a lot of importance and influence. It\u2019s really the same shit. Kanye is basically saying he is as important to the world and history as Gandhi. \n\nI think Yandhi might be as crazy as Yeezus. I think rather than a humble, peaceful \u201clove everyone\u201d Kanye, we might see flexing, braggadocious, self-important Kanye. Which exites me more to be honest. I like that Kanye and I like the kind of music that Kanye makes.\n\nJust a thought I had. Maybe everyone is looking at the Yandhi/Gandhi thing all wrong. Maybe it\u2019s not about the teachings of Gandhi, but rather Kanye comparing himself to a great historical figure. Gandhi just sounded good with a Y in front, and maybe that\u2019s the extent of the thought Kanye put behind it. ",

I think there\u2019s a reason why the cover is a mini disk, and not a regular cd like Yeezus. Even though mini disks do hold around 75 minutes (just looked this up), the cover may symbolize the fact that this is a single, or an ep with only a handful of songs. \n\nIt would make sense to premiere \u201cYandhi\u201d on SNL if it were a single, or maybe even something wild like a 2 part song or a 10 minute performance piece, however unlikely this is. \n\nObviously I\u2019m hoping I\u2019m wrong and we do get a great album and a possible sequel to my second favorite Kanye album, but there just has not been that much time since Kanye dropped for me to honestly expect a full fledged project will drop next Saturday. I would recommend keeping expectations low for this, it would only make it better if it turned out to be as great as its being currently hyped as.

The entire thread is worth reading, but I got [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/993aiz/ama_we_know_an_audio_engineer_who_worked_on_ye/e4kqwdh/?context=8&depth=9) answer from them concerning pre-TMZ ye.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo my question is, do you think, since Good Ass Job was supposed to be the finale of the four part series beginning with TCD, that we will get the sounds described by the engineer here? A College Dropout album with a Pablo flow? Or do you think since Kanye is working with Chance he will push that style towards Yandhi? Perhaps you think I'm heavily full of shit?",
