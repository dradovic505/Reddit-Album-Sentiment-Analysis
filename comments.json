Unless he scrapped the Sep-Oct version and made a new one by December. But even that doesn\u2019t really make sense.\n\nAs for currently, I think he\u2019s scrapped the songs that were leaked not because they got leaked though. And I kinda imagine that there\u2019s a new album with the song \u201cWater\u201d, and maybe some other SS songs \u201cWe Have Everything We Need\u201d \u201cGarden\u201d. And as further evidence the melodies in We Have Everything We Need are EXACTLY the same as the leaked song The Storm. EXACTLY the same, so maybe he scrapped November Yandhi and transferred some parts to original Sunday Service songs that are on a new album.\n\nIf I turn out to be right that\u2019ll be great because we\u2019ll get to listen to a studio version of Water and not my screen recording from Coachella.",

Example: For me, I put LR #3 & CD #4, while to me both \"Gone\" & \"Jesus Walks\" are top 10 Kanye songs, I enjoy Gone more than I do \"Jesus Walks\". Both albums are also 21 tracks, but I enjoy LR because it's more than 2/3rds of songs while CD is more than 1/3rds of skits/interludes.

It also wouldn't surprise me if we are still talking about this a year from now. Kanye has definitely prioritized Sunday Service as of recent. However, the color scheme of Sunday Service at Coachella did match Yandhi's theme though. Furthermore, I'm not sure if the formation of Sunday Service crowd at Coachella and the image of Kanye surrounded by shoes are deliberately supposed to invoke CD vibes (like Yeezus or Yandhi's covers) but it definitely reminds me of that. Even the way the shoes are laid out looks like the CD relfection on Yeezus or Yandhi. It's also entirely possible that the circle formations are just an influence of James Turrell's circular art that Kanye was posting a lot on his social media last year.",

Not his fault, his mother dying, getting fucked over by friends/family and the whole jay z fiasco did a real number on him and it shows. But i guess without that happening we never would have gotten yeezus which is just an incredible project.\nI honestly don't know how people think his latest stuff has good wordplay because it really doesnt other than a few clever lines here and there. \nHe seems to be doing much better now and he's fine tuning his album it seems so I fully expect Yandhi to be MBDTF level.

Using particular lighting, aesthetics, sounds and formations that lend to a healing experience through his music. I think that is something that the world needs and I think he can do it. But only if he takes his time and meticulously crafts the experience as he did with MBDTF. I don't think Yandhi will be ready for a while and I am okay with that.",

      "body": "Take aways:\n\nThe very beginning was cute, Kanye talking about mundane things is always kind of interesting. Breakfast and such. Talking about his kids was also very cute, you can tell how much happiness he gets from being a father.\n\nBut immediately after that, when he's talking about his code and all that, left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm not sure why, I think Kanye talking about this is a way that implies you're preordained to be what you are and nothing can change that is questionable. But, maybe I'm reading too much into it. \n\nInteresting how quickly he pulled a Drake lyric out of the air to be compared to the conversation though. I know he's a musician and all and Drake isn't low key or anything, but it shows how ingrained lyricism and music is in Kanye's identity, I think. Its also really interesting to see Kanye be so self-aware about his music. Maybe I've just never seen it, but seeing him talk about his ego in relation to music was something I've never seen before.\n\nThe minimalism in Kim/Kanye's house is crazy, they're seriously embodying it. I also thought it was interesting that Kanye often turned and looked directly at the camera/crew behind it and engaged with them when he was talking. A lot of the time in interviews styled like this the crew is a ghost and you only interact with the interviewer. \n\nKanye dressing David was fun, and Kanye really seemed to be enjoying it. \n\nThe Bipolar conversation was dicey, I knew it was going to be. But Kanye seems sincere about wanting to spread understanding of being Bipolar and being in control of it. When he was talking about his paranoia and when he gets manic, you could see how emotional he was getting about it. I think this is the first time I've seen him say that he's not advocating for being off of medication, which is a huge reversal of I think what the public thinks his stance on it is. I'm also really surprised to see how self-aware he is about this. The advantages he has in being rich and famous and the access he has because of it. \n\nDavid and Kanye had a really healthy conversation about it, and the fight between identity and mental health. And Kanye's recognition of their access in comparison to others takes me back to his long standing fight against classism. \n\n\"I would, though. I love arguing\" - Probably my favorite quote from this. \n\nKanye's take on YesAllWomen was questionable, but it was really obvious to me that they cut parts out of that conversation so hard for me to feel anything about it.\n\nHis take on the 13th Amendment was real, and him having to prompt the audience in response was interesting. Over all I think this might have been one of 'Ye's best expressions of his political views. He's getting better at expressing his thoughts and feelings more coherently. I know people read he was going to talk about politics and they were expecting nonsense, this was much better. \n\nWatching him talk about Sunday Service makes me so excited for Yandhi. I don't know if we'll ever seen Yandhi or if we end up with something else, but his philosophy on using music for healing is something I think he's been trending towards for a long time, and he's only just now realizing it, as he said.

I think it's safe to say he feels like it's at least a 7 and maybe an 8 now, but the problem is people will give him so much shit for just changing his mind so it's not even worth saying it grew on him for the sake of changing it by a mere 1-2 points. \n\nSo you're talking about a 7.7 or 7.8 average depending on whether he thinks MBDTF is a 7 or 8. Which is great. He thinks two of his albums are meh. He likes two of them. He loves three of them. He thinks one is near perfect. And he thinks two are perfect. And he really likes what he heard from the Sunday Service snippets and is excited for Yandhi or whatever Kanye decides to call it. It's fair to say he's a pretty big fan of Kanye's work as a whole, even if he doesn't like him as a person.",

During this time he seemed to be tweeting about a lot of spiritual subject matter that could be seen on Yandhi. I was confused why we didn\u2019t see any of these elements on Ye but I have a theory. Kanye has been working on Yandhi right after his mental breakdown and coming back from the hospital. But as he said in some interviews he didn\u2019t feel like he had his confidence or energy at the time. So he went to isolation and trained himself back up again in doing what he knows best which is sampling. This is why most of the tracks that came from Wyoming are samples and why a lot of the production was solely just him and had less collaboration. It explains why Yandhi was announced shortly after he dropped all those albums since he usually likes to take a lot of time when it comes to albums. He\u2019s been working on it for a while.",

I also consider the pic and color scheme you used in College Dropout x Ye more in line with Yandhi era Kanye so it's just a little jarring to see that with the rest of the Ye albums.

A quick google search and I found this:\n\n> As the most prominent color during the Season of Lent, especially on **Good Friday**, it signifies sorrow and suffering\u2014specifically for Jesus' suffering during his 40 days in the desert. **Violet represents penance, humility, and melancholy. It's also associated with power and royalty and spiritual wealth.**\n\nI think the album's main themes will be the ones that the violet color represents.",

Even before that sometime in November Kanye tweeted that the album doesn\u2019t even have a release date anymore... extremely unprofessional but whatever.. \n\n\nTHEN\n\nKanye fans said that yandhi could drop January 29th... and of course it didn\u2019t \n\n\nAnd what now... the same exact thing happened. \n\nYandhi will be released after Sunday servicbe!!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!2!!2!2!1!1!1!\n\n\n\nCome on gguys, I\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted but it\u2019s almost been a year. You\u2019re still waiting on that album? He\u2019s probably trashed it by now..",

After the Taylor Swift incident, I hated him even more. I was like how can you do this to such a young girl? I always thought he wanted to promote himself with these actions. \n\nI liked a few of his songs like Stronger and some of his other Graduation stuff Good life, Homecoming etc. But wouldn't listen to them often.\n\nFast forward to the day Yeezus dropped. Everyone was like: \"What is this trash, He calls himself God ...\" \n\nI am thinking thats typical Kanye again with the controversy. Lets see what this trash album is about...\n\nI was simply blown away by the production. I am a huge electronic music fan from the days of old school house, trance etc. I can still remember the first time hearing Hold my liquor... What a unique way to mix a song, how he sampled it, the drums, the guitars, the verses it just simply blew me away. To this day Yeezus still holds a special place in my heart.\n\nMBDTF made me a true fan. It is probably one of my favorite albums of all time - hence my username.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan't wait for Yandhi to drop!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

It blew my mind, the first time I liatened to it I fell asleep halfway through and woke up to the phone call in 30 Hours. Gave it a better listen over the next couple of days. Then I fell in love and for the nect month my entire music rotation was TLOP and Starboy from The Weeknd.\n\nIt wasnt until like a year later that I got spotify and decided I lose nothing to give his music a listen. I started with graduation. \n\nUnfortunately I didnt like it at first (I blame my shitty headphones at the time). Then I tried listening to 808s with the same shit headphones and disnt get it because there were no 808s in the whole album. \n\nI went home and put on MBDTF with my good headphones on my pc while playing rocket league. That was when i realized I needed better work headphones. Got some better headphones for work and proceeded to binge kanye  over the next 3 months or so. Listening to an album from start to finish and going to the next one, then shuffling all his music. \n\nThen KSG came out and I did the exact same thing but with Cudi.

A lot of the time you'll see multiple artists working with a similar sound around the same time without being aware of one another for this very reason. I would say they're 'drinking from the same well' if that makes sense.\n\n3) It could be any of those three. As we know, Kanye could scrap everything and start fresh at any given moment in an album cycle. If we take him at his word (about Yandhi being more meticulously crafted over a longer period of time) then I would suspect these arrangements will show up on the album in some form.

But, now i feel it reveals a lot about the industry facade and how it can harm an artists (or viewer/listener's) mental state and how the power of family and true self is the only true remedy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome context before I start. For one, this thing is going to be long, my people. There is a lot going on with this album, and the context of its creation. The TL;DR is the same as half the fanbase. I thought it was good but short and lacking in content. I felt it didnt explain much. But I was wrong. Extremely wrong. I used to like ***KIDS SEE GHOSTS*** more. It was wilder and had the bombast I wanted from ***ye*** at the time. But my opinion has since changed. Duh. Favorite song is ***Yikes*** currently but it always changes. Favorite moment would be the rocket blips during Shake's refrain on ***Ghost Town***. Score is 10/10 on most days, 9.1/10 on its worst. In terms of Ye's discog, it'd be in between ***Pablo*** (2nd) and ***Yeezus*** (4th) for third place overall, with ***Dark Fantasy*** being first.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight..... context. Kanye cancelled the Saint Pablo tour amidst a fit of exhaustion and bewilderment at the state of the media, recording industry, fashion industry, and other creative industries. The final show ended 5 songs in, in which Kanye finally snapped at the entire circus in front of him. Cutting off his performance of *Famous*, he ranted hard against the hypocritical nature of the election, the deceitful recording industry, and the instability of his own well being. The idea that half the nation supported Donald Trump but were fearful to admit it facing obvious alienation for doing so bothered him.\n\nHe knew Jay-Z and Beyonce didn't support Hilary Clinton herself. Nor Chance, nor J Cole. He knew talking about this would ruin his public well standing. He praised Kid Cudi for keeping it real and portraying himself as realistically as he did. He begged Jay-Z not to send hitters after him for talking about him. Considering Jay-Z was friends with Harvey Weinstein, a man known for sending men to his victims' houses to threaten them (and also a known liberal), this could be a likelihood now that Ye was talking about all of this with gusto.\n\nYe, fearful, but resolute on telling his truth, ended the show, the tour, the entire life cycle for *The Life Of Pablo* in true Saint Pablo fashion, with the sentence that best sums up ye as an album: ***\"Get ready to have a field day, press! Cause the show's over!\"***. He suffered a mental breakdown a few days later, due to sleep deprivation. The sleep deprivation will come into play later. It's extremely important to this album and what's happening now with Ye. In the ensuing months, Kim Kardashian would be robbed and kidnapped despite paying for security and Kanye would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder and put on medication. Kanye would elaborate his struggles with creating music he considered great while on medication in a series of lengthy tweets later after the 5 album rollout was through.\n\nYe went on Twitter publicly supporting Donald Trump and wearing the MAGA hat (and developing ideas to help the ideas he believed were beneficial from the movement). He went to TMZ and eventually slipped that he thought \"slavery sounded like a choice to him\". At the initial, aborted, run up to Yandhi, Ye went on a rant at the end of Saturday Night Live defending the president and espousing observations he had based on the liberal media (a rant that host Adam Driver probably destroyed his room over). Throughout these instances Kanye had revealed that he was slowly removing himself from his medication and attempting to conquer what was over diagnosed bi-polar disorder on his own. Mean while the media pushed the assertion that he should be on medication at all times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***ye,*** as an album, has all of this baggage on its plate and millions of listeners expecting to resolve and explain (retcon, morelike).

It was very late at night, so the subway was mostly empty except for a man nodding off, wearing some sweats and a large military jacket. I sat across from him. After a few minutes the man jerked awake. I had the sudden urge to go up and kiss the man's ass - I was presented with the presence of god. I controlled my primal urges, and instead pretended not to be surprised. He looked at me, I nodded my head, and he nodded back. Soon after he pulled out his yePhone, and started swiping the screen. In the windows of the dimly lit train, I saw the reflection of the phone. Kanye was on Reddit.\n\nAfter scrolling through the front page, Kanye cautiously looked around, and clicked on the [r/Kanye](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye) subreddit link. As the posts loaded his expression turned to one of childish wonder. As he scrolled further, I noticed Kanye's bulge was becoming bigger. The wonderment turned to a look of pure evil, as Kanye put his hands down his pants and pulled out his abnormally large member. He started stroking it slowly, and then faster and faster. As he got closer to his finish, he started orgasmically yelling out his own name. He called kim and told her he didn't need her anymore, and he quite literally proceeded to ride his own. After finishing, kanye calmly got up and started to walked past me (note that he didn't bother to pull up his sweatpants, after all it was 3 AM in Chicago, this is not uncommon) Before getting off, he put his hand on my shoulder and said that I could have one wish. At this point, I felt some sort of power run through me, a power that no one man should have.\n\nIf you rode the blue line and noticed something sticky on one of the seats, know that it is the literal spawn of god.

He really had a come back, but Kanye also went off, especially on 4th Dimension, Kids See Ghosts(track), and Cudi Montage.\n\nI will admit that his discography has dropped off a little, TLOP was messy and Ye was weak but there are some excuses for it. First off, he has had mental health issues. But secondly, and this is only a theory as of right now, but I think he is experimenting with a more minimalist experimental style akin to James Blake, who he said was his favorite artist, but with a twist of Keyon Christ. Keyon Christ has produced for Kanye, Rihanna, Desiigner, Lil Yachty and was supposed to help produce on Kids See Ghosts. He has a very distinct electronic/vocal manipulation style. His influence is *very* apparent on the opener of Ye, I thought about killing you. So I personally feel like those were him just throwing out ideas for this new style, and Yandhi will be him perfecting it.\n\nAlso, the song w Lil Pump HAD to be a joke. Lil Pump doesn't really take himself seriously, and the song itself was dropped at the Pornhub Awards. My man... lol. I don't think it was ever supposed to be a serious artistic effort. For the YNW Melly song, and I can definitely be reaching here, but I think it was to bring him up. I personally had not heard of him, and it seems you are not too familiar with him also, but the song itself is pretty much just another Pop song. It has a really really catchy hook with a sweet melody, and a ton of major chords with a sugary instrumental. Again, that may be a reach but its a speculation.\n\nEdit: Damn, I can write a shit ton lol\n\nEdit 2: To further support my argument for the new minimalist electronic style, Yandhi is a spiritual successor to Yeezus, his previous experimental electronic album",

Yours, but also he helped four of his very talented musical peers' albums during the summer, Cudi, T, Teyana, and Nas. Overall, the albums were fairly strong, with Daytona and, again, Kids See Ghosts being very very strong. So he is not really derailing his G.O.O.D music signees by helping create strong albums. Furthermore, it could be seen that instead of trying to gain clout(because he's fucking KANYE, he's a legend) he's trying to embrace the younger generation. Most older people in the rap community reject the direction rap is going in, but by collaborating with older artists Kanye is accepting the changing times.

People start making up scenarios so they could fit the punchline. People forget the part of \"joke\", just post the punchline. The punchline devolves in a simple hashtag.

      "body": "college dropout pretty simply revolutionized hip hop. kanye started by producing for jay z, but wanted to start rapping by himself and said \"hey rap doesnt have to be just gangster. im gonna rap about jesus and my actual life n shit\" and it revolutionized EVERYTHING.\n\nlate registration is basically more of the same, although thats not a bad thing. he refines his songwriting and instrumentation, and i like late registration more personally. graduation is where things got heated again (at least as far as i know), with the 50 cent controversy. basically, they were both releasing on the same day and were competing to see who would sell more (kanye blew fifty out of the water lol).\n\nin between graduation and 808s, kanyes life sorta fell apart. his mom died and his girlfriend broke up with him, sending him spiraling. he channeled this energy into a new sound, focusing on heavy 808s (very artificial kick drum sounds) and a much more poppy rap/singsongy sound. this album set the stage for ANOTHER new wave of rap, like drake.\n\nmbdtf is wild as shit. a lot of people hated 808s, and it was his least well received album of his career. all of the shit in his life culminated with the infamous VMA's incident, where he drunkenly got on stage and interrupted Taylor's acceptance speech. at this point, the media turned on kanye like CRAZY. everybody hated him, and it looked like the end of his career. so, what he did was what kanye does best: put his all into his music. he retreated to hawaii and worked in seclusion, bringing in the best minds, voices, and talents in hip hop (and music in general) to create his magnum opus, both the culmination of grandiose and opulent production and a reflection on fame, twisting his existence as a figure of fame into some much darker, more grossly exaggerated figure that he used to highlight his own flaws and his godlike artistry. its an okay album \ud83e\udd14\n\ncruel summer and watch the throne, his two albums that you probably didnt know the existence of if you just look at his spotify page, are less important imo. cruel summer is him creating a collaborative record with the constituents of his G.O.O.D music record, probably his weakest project to date, and watch the throne is a collab album with jay z, viewed as jay z passing the torch of hip hop legend onto kanye (and is also the one with nathans in paris). like i said, theyre less important so ill spend less time talking about them.\n\nyeezus is kanyes foray into experimental hip hop, and is either his best or his worst album based on who you ask. personally, i think its weak as far as experimental hip hop goes although it does have its strengths. i haven't heard of any big big story behind this album, but new slaves and black skinhead are two incredibly abrasive and poignant tracks that are very popular and made waves. blood on the leaves also gave him a lot of negative attention both on release and to this day due to his use of the nina simone sample. listening to the song, the primary vocal sample is a song about lynchings and black people hanging from trees, and kanye takes it and flips it to talk about his relationships and superficial problems. im a huge fan of it as an artistic statement, but i digress. overall, a very angry, brash, and aggressive album.\n\nthe life of pablo is a very interesting album. its rollout was total shit, with a bunch of revisions, name changes, release date pushbacks, etc. it was premiered at some event and then (if im right) not even released for another couple weeks or so. on top of this, the album underwent several changes after it was already released, with kanye editing certain production elements and going so far as to add a brand new song, saint pablo, after it had already been out for a decent while. it's also easily his least cohesive album, switching wildly between sounds, topics, tones. this dissonance serves a point, however, and is one of my favorite kanye albums.\n\nthe life of pablo tour is where things started to get incredibly hectic again for kanye. after a few shows where he infamously stopped his show early and just ranted to the audience for an incredibly long time, he had to cancel the rest of the tour due to mental health issues and check in to an institute, where his disorders started to come into the public eye. he deleted all social media and spent a while working on his clothing brand, sticking mostly to himself (if im right. some of the details may be a bit off, but im sure youll get the gist). \n\nafter around a year, kanye came back in a big way. he reactivated his twitter and a bunch of shit started happening from there. he announced five albums, one from pusha t (fantastic artist, i highly recommend listening to daytona, the album kanye executively produced and released in late may of last year), one from him, one as a collab between him and kid cudi, one from nas, and one from teyana taylor - all five produced by him, and all five having seven songs each. they released in back to back weeks, and is referred to as the GOOD summer among kanye fans (less important but w/e). between the announcement and the album release, kanye started several very large shitstorms with his trump endorsements, turning a large portion of his fanbase against him and getting twitter to \"cancel\" him. he went on to score the #1 album on billboard, as a side note. ye, his solo album, is an incredibly heartfelt record and deals with his insecurities, mental health issues, and family. it received pretty mixed reception, although a lot of kanye fans love it and see it as his most intimate album to date. kids see ghosts, his collaborative album with kid cudi, is another seven song record and famously received a 10/10 from anthony fantano. it deals with mental health in a unique and refreshing way, both experimental and accessible. it blends elements of psych rock and hip hop, and was met with widespread positive reception - from kanye fans. both ye and kids see ghosts were notoriously negatively received by most mainstream critics, which many theorize is as a result of his trump antics and his divisive political stance. the rest of the albums arent that important in terms of kanye, although nas' and teyana's albums are both fairly good in their own rights.\n\nand thats it for his albums. after his string of albums, he announced three more: watch the throne two, good ass job (the spiritual successor to graduation and the capstone to the tcd-lr-grad trilogy), and yandhi which was supposed to come out september 29, then black friday, then pushed back to a thus unannounced date. now you're all caught up! i hope this long ass write up was helpful/you enjoyed it. have fun listening!",

It takes a long time to change yourself into a better person, so that is why he went back to being his old self.\n\nBy the end of Yeezus, Kanye pretty much gives up on changing the world for now. He wants to change himself first. Yeezus is about him realizing he needs to change. The Life of Pablo is the journey of him making the change. Saint Pablo is another name for Paul The Apostle. Saint Pablo used to be a bad man who changed himself into a good person and became a saint. That's why The Life of Pablo is called that. \n\nBased on this, I believe Yandhi will be about Kanye attempting to finally change the world. \n\n&#x200B;",

My grouping doesn't account for the fact that Yeezus and TLOP are basically the same album concept, just one is much less musical than the other. You could also say Graduation and 808s go together as his more genre-pushing/redefining efforts. You can split it up into \"Old Kanye\" and \"New Kanye\". Your theory also makes a lot of sense.

Further stuff about the payment options and all that will be discussed later.\n\n* How's everything?\n\nIf we look at it with a negative light, we're not going to reach the release date of one day before Yandhi (AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA, remember that?) at all, but we want to, so as I said before:\n\n\n*Ahem*\n\n\n**WE NEED SUBMISSIONS.

Why can't he be original like he did for KSG and MBDTF. It shows a lot more effort and direction. The image for yandhi literally existed on the internet before he decided to use it as his own. Imagine a cover for Turbo Grafx 16 that would be so dope. When Kanye made the cover for MBDTF, the artist went over the album and listened to it multiple times while making the cover. Kanye also went over countless versions before picking the one he felt right. Now what does a mini disc have to do with the content that's on the album??? ",

Kanye is very self-aware (despite popular belief) I think Kanye is fully aware of how the last albums were received as a whole and wants to make a different approach. A lot of shit has happened since he left Africa. Stopped wearing the MAGA hat n parting ways with politics, being more vocal or showing more actions on HIS stances rather than standing next to people in hopes to change theirs and being mistaken for adopting their beliefs and stances. The shooting at the video shoot, the fire, ending those crazy ass events with a performance at CFG with Cudi and people screaming \"WERE STILL THE KIDS WE USED TO BEEE\" (which was just as legendary as how i pictured it in my head lol) he has a lot of new perspective to give FOR SURE\n\n\nBut hey, maybe until we get Yandhi he'll finish his collab with Ty Dollar Sign or finishing the album with Talib Kweli or Chance The Rapper in the meantime -shrugs-",

Kanye himself stated that this was the cause of purple demon emojis that came his way\n\nc. Can you even call lift yourself a track? gibberish. Scatting. That alone is plausible,kanye being an Indian giver over here, letting him have the track but screwed him by dropping it. Drake even said in the talk with tez. \u201cThey know this was gonna be a hit, they just needed to give it, suddenly he\u2019s got no time and focused on HIS album lol \n\nTez himself even reminded drake: these are Competitions, they want an edge they want to win over you \n\nThat said, the only  one close to worshiping here is you.

KSG is only better than Ye IMO but all of Kanye's other albums are better.

That said, I'm going to get bored of Cudi fast if he can't make more versatile songs like Mr Rager, Maniac, or spew out anything that sounds close to MOTM days compared to the primarily polished upbeat tracks that sound like only a glimpse of what he has to offer. \n\nYe was just super disappointing, if it was any other artist it would be a very well received album but looking at the bigger picture I only thought Yikes and Ghost Town were the highlights of the album.

I don't think he'll ever be able to compete with Kanye's legacy though, Travis reminds me a bit of Kanye in some ways but I think they're too different to even try and compare their runs especially when Kanye is a legend while Travis has just put out consistently good improving music. Years from now if Travis keeps improving or reigns supreme over his peers then it would be the time to compare them fairly. I don't think there will be another Kanye West, Travis being as successful as he is already seems like a big accomplishment in modern hip hop but we'd be grasping at straws to pinpoint similarities. If Travis goes on a legendary run and keeps improving while influencing hip hop heavily then he might earn the title of the new generation's Kanye.",

Creative people can thrive off it. It seems like Kanye is in a manic state right now. He\u2019s announced several projects. Yandhi, Good Ass Job, Throne2. At the same time he also wants to solve all the world\u2019s problems. He\u2019s meeting with Trump, he\u2019s inventing recycling, he\u2019s giving speeches on tables to design classes. It\u2019s great that he\u2019s in such a creative mindset and his head is buzzing with ideas, but the issue then becomes actually doing anything with those ideas and making them happen.\n\nChance\u2019s appearance on the Joe Budden podcast was pretty disappointing as it related to Kanye. He revealed work hasn\u2019t even begun on Good Ass Job. That was just another idea Kanye had that he decided to make public before that idea had actually manifested itself. And when Chance was asked if by the time Kanye got around to actually doing Good Ass Job he\u2019d still want to do it, Chance said he didn\u2019t know. \n\nThat seems to be the way with Kanye. He has a lot of ideas, but whether those ideas become a reality is another story. He has a neat idea to make an album called Yandhi and record in it Africa in the open air with nature sounds. Whether that actually happens remains to be seen. I am not going to be disappointed if it doesn\u2019t. I\u2019m expecting nothing. At this point Yandhi to me is just an idea in Kanye\u2019s head. I\u2019ll be thrilled if it turns into more than that, but I won\u2019t be disappointed if it doesn\u2019t. ",

I really like a lot of the music he released this year, but I don't view Ye or KSG as certified classics. I know KSG is beloved on this sub because many are also Cudi fans, but aside from Daytona, I view the Wyoming Sessions as being about quantity over quality. It felt a tad watered down from pretty much every album he's released prior to this year. It's why Dark Fantasy ended up his masterpiece, because he brought a team to Hawaii for quite some time who were all dedicated with one goal in mind: to make his masterpiece. And it ended up, in my estimation, the greatest rap album of all time. Let me reiterate I really enjoyed all of the Wyoming Sessions records, but I do believe he's capable of much better, he has proven that since his career began.

I even went through mental gymnastics on a daily basis in an attempt to tell people how Kanye was just \"thinking on another level\" or some bullshit.\n\nHowever, I was having a casual debate with some people today - white folk. To which one of them pointed out some of Kanye's arguments revolving around slavery and/or Donald Trump. So, take that in for a quick moment. We have white dudes out here saying it's okay because a black guy said it. Which I know isn't the case in the slightest - you all know that. Everyone with an ounce of intelligence knows that, but then there's the majority that doesn't. The people who were already borderline white supremacists, the people that supported the shit Trump preached, etc.\n\nKanye isn't a stable individual. I'm sorry but he's just not. He hasn't been since his mom died. \"Oh but he has a family now and a loving wife.\" You're out of your damn mind if you think Kim has an ounce of stability after everything she's been through as well.\n\nI love Kanye, man. I'll always love his music, and I'll always thank him for getting me through what he did. However even if this IS just marketing and means of stirring controversy for his own publicity/brand - then i'm fucking sick of it because it's not necessarily doing his fans any favours. Not to mention the fact that Yandhi didn't even come out on time. I mean, that's fairly entitled of us to want that but if he can't keep a simple promise then what makes you think he's seriously some dude on another level with some \"next-level\" opinion?\n\nTake care y'all.",

It implies that yandhi is an acronym.\n\nEDIT 2: Reminder that yeezus was recorded in paris. This guy might be french, there could be a connection. Also, if it's possible, make it so that this post auto-sorts comments by new, so new info is seen more quickly.\n\nEDIT 3: in the source code of the tumblr this is listed as the avatar: https://66.media.tumblr.com/avatar_c4227b97f326_128.pnj looks similiar to the gif\n\nEDIT 4: searching \"you are new divine holographic immersion\" (from the tumblr page, acronym for YANDHI) leads to this: http://gateofunity.com/main/signup-divine-matrix-holographic-soul-prayerhealing/ and a bunch of other weird spiritual shit that's probably unrelated but more importantly, THIS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7wf-gqc-X8 seem familiar? It should....\n\nEDIT 5: also this: https://www.amazon.com/Divine-Programmer-II-Humans-Reality/dp/1927066115 relates to the whole simulation thing kanye's been going on about.  I think that, regardless if this is an actual ARG, our findings DO suggest what yandhi will be about lyrically. He already updated us on his situation on ye, i think he's really going to dive deep into this holographic/simulation philosophy on this album. If this is an arg, i think the acronym will be somewhere in the album. Also this book title contains the word programming. I think kanye will rap about how we are not just in a simulation, but a video game or some shit. Holy shit a hip hop album about how we're in a sim... that would be amazing.",

I'll always love his music, and I'll always thank him for getting me through what he did. However even if this IS just marketing and means of stirring controversy for his own publicity/brand - then i'm fucking sick of it because it's not necessarily doing his fans any favours. Not to mention the fact that Yandhi didn't even come out on time. I mean, that's fairly entitled of us to want that but if he can't keep a simple promise then what makes you think he's seriously some dude on another level with some \"next-level\" opinion? \n\nTake care y'all. \n\n",

I'm actually anxious because I want to listen to it the moment it drops, and I have no clue when that will be. It could drop in two hours or in two days, possibly even longer. \n\nI already feel like Kanye put out all the music he needs to this year, music that I personally think is some of his best work (feel free to disagree). But since he went as far as to formally advertise YANDHI before it's release (something he didn't really do with Ye or KSG), I'd go as far as to assume Ye himself thinks he has something amazing on his hands. And if that's the case, I want those sound waves penetrating my ear holes ASAP, no homo.\n\nSince we are now approaching 24 hours past the initial release date, I'm not super disappointed. Sure, it's a little disappointing to not be able to listen to an album when you think you'll be able to, but this isn't the first time it's happened. Just a few weeks ago, we didn't even know this album existed (at least I didn't, maybe you have inside sources). I don't want to be entitled by bitching about not being able to listen to music that I couldn't make myself, produced by an artist who's already released and produced several albums this year. However, I do want to make sure I'm able to listen to it the moment it finally drops.\n\n(On the low though, I'm not a fan of Kanye outside of the music. I don't buy the clothes or the shoes, I don't follow his social unless he's in album drop mode, and I personally think he speaks before he thinks a little too often. But damn, even my least favorite Kanye album is better than the majority of music out there imo. That opinion alone is why I'm so eager to listen to any official music he puts out as soon as I can.)\n\nI'm just rambling though, this is a moment in time I'll probably forget regardless of if/when YANDHI drops. Just felt like sharing with y'all since I've been thinking about it a lot today. Sorry if it's incoherent/pointless.",

Like it feels like it\u2019s more about Kanye is doing some wack shit oh and he has an album too, I guess.\n\nI think his later projects (TLOP/Ye) suffer from this and while I still think they are good albums, I personally consider them his weakest IMO.

Fasting\u00a0was a weapon used by\u00a0Gandhi\u00a0as part of his philosophy of Ahimsa (non-violence). Don't you get it? In his previous album, Ye, the last track was called Violent Crimes. Yandhi will pick up where Ye stopped (Violent Crimes), it will show the ascension of Ye to Yahndi, by starting a peaceful revolution and entice the disciples (the future listeners) to do the same). This will start World Love 1, and a new \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf0a era. Stay tuned and be pacient.\n\nDon't believe it? Fine. Only people with 4th dimension perspective will understand.

It was announced by West on his Instagram and Twitter on September 17, 2018. Its minimalist album art, featuring a MiniDisc with purple tape, has been compared to that of West's sixth studio album Yeezus (2013), with speculation that it may be a follow-up to the album.The album will feature an array of guest artists, including Birdman , Daz Dillinger, Kid Rock, Master P, and posthumous vocals from XXXTentacion. Rihanna is also expected to be featured, but her vocals have not been recorded yet.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Kanye/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28",

Those people who expect this sound seemed to have forgotten that Yeezus was originally a 3 hour beat tape whose sound was closer to age of adz than anything, which Kanye was very inspired by at the time (as it sounded like a more electronic MBDTF), before it was cut down and Kanye decided on a new sound in the last few weeks, bringing in producers from the post-industrial scene from tri angle to try and achieve this new sound.\n\nThe unreleased Yeezus tracks that have leaked all sound nothing like the Yeezus sound. In fact, the most glaring part of each is how much Kanye sings.  That is where I think this new project is going. An electronic soul rnb trap album. When you start thinking about it like this, everything falls into place. \n\nFirst, the snippet that Kanye released already highlights this style. From the trap drums to Kanye's voice modifications. It would fit this pseudo-yeezus style perfectly.\n\nSecondly, the features would begin to make sense. 6ix9ine won't be used aggressively, he will instead be using his normal voice, singing, something he attempted in his latest single. X will be utilized the same way.\n\nThirdly, note how the red seal on the Yeezus cover (highlighting the albums sense of power and theme of anger) turns a less intense purple.\n\nIt all fits too perfectly. Prove me wrong.",

While producing albums for Nas, Pusha T, Kids See Ghost, etc., he's been also working on his own material. And, being Kanye, he's had the privilege to save the best tracks from this almost two year long recording project all to himself. He saved the best of the best for Yandhi.\n\nBut then... he sort of had that public spaz out. Went crazy on Twitter. Because he loves to challenge himself, he said \"Fuck it, I'ma scrap everything\" and decided to make Ye in a little under two weeks. This is why Ye was so short and, in many ways, unpolished. There were multiple songs where Kanye just didn't even finish writing the lyrics - I mean he would end a bar with \"UH!\" instead of coming up with an actual rhyme. Overall, I like Ye, I see what he was going for, but I (like many others) believe it could have been a lot better if he just had more time to, well, finish the songs.\n\nThe good news tonight, boys? Yandhi is done. It's been done. He's been working on it for two years, and has been saving this in his back pocket all year long. You really think he \"scrapped\" an entire album just for the hell of it? Of course not.\n\nAgain, Kanye loves to challenge himself. He gave himself a mission: create a seven song album in two weeks, and see if anyone notices that it was made in just two weeks.\n\nWell, he kind of failed in that respect... but I'm still glad he tried. Ye is still a good album.\n\nHe had Yandhi ready to go all along, in the event that he couldn't complete Ye on time. Ye was a spur of the moment thing. He didn't even have the album cover until an hour before it dropped. Yandhi is anything but that. It has a clearly defined concept: It's Yeezus 2. It has an album cover. It has marketing and billboards all across the world. Ye dropped early because it had to; Kanye set the arbitrary date of his Wyoming event as the deadline for the project. However, there's no reason to rush Yandhi. No tour coming up, no events, nothing. It came out of nowhere, seemingly. But in reality, it was completed a few months ago. Kanye was just waiting for things to die down a little, and maybe use the final few months to just put in last minute production details or re-work the setlist.\n\nThis is reason to be hype, folks. Most of the complaints of Ye, TLOP, and the original Yeezus? They were all sort of rushed. There were last second addendums and changes. His last album to be completely polished, with plenty of time to spare? My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.\n\nIt's happening, boys.",

I'm heavy into rap. Yeezus to me is rap, rock, and a true piece of art. Look at what it did to rap, even that year. Rick Ross's \"Mastermind\" was his personal Yeezus. Jay Z had \"Magna Carta\". These guys were still making rap/hip hop, but now they were making actual music to go along with their thoughts and ideas. Anyways, I found my Yeezus CD (and case) a couple days ago. Listened to the entire album yesterday. Listening to it again as I'm typing this. Yeezus is his best album. It's a nail biter from start to finish. I hope that Yandhi is it's actual successor.

Namely Black Skinhead and New Slaves. A lot of what he said about slavery and black conservatives suggests he had a lot to say on the same sort of themes as Black Skinhead and New Slaves. The \u201cgiving up my slave name\u201d song we\u2019ve heard a bit of could be a sequel to New Slaves.\n\nA few people like Charlemagne and Big Boy heard the original Love Everyone. Apparently XTCY was on it, so was Lift Yourself and Cops Shot the Kid. He gave CSTK to Nas, so that\u2019s out, but XTCY and Lift Yourself could be on Yandhi. Everyone has always wanted to hear Lift Yourself with proper lyrics. We could finally hear that on Yandhi.\n\n80 Degrees will be on it. Hopefully with re-recorded vocals. I think that snippet might be an indication of what sort of sound Kanye might be going for on Yandhi. \u201cGiving up my slave name\u201d has a similar vibe. It won\u2019t sound like Yeezus.

Time will tell what impact this more experimental route will have on music.\n\nFor the non-musical stuff, John Lennon famously declared the Beatles were bigger than Jesus, which he wasnt completely wrong about. The Beatles became a cultural phenomenon the world had never seen, and went from cultural icons to historical icons. And then think of songs like \u201cImagine\u201d where he tried to use his music to portray a message of world peace and love, very similar to what Kanye is doing/thinks hes doing with Yandhi and his recent \u201cLove Everyone\u201d vibes.\n\nThis isnt completely formed cuz like i said i dont know a lot about rock and im rushing writing this between classes lol, but you could definitely find more examples of rock stars thinking that they and their music will \u201cchange the world\u201d.\n\nI think itd be a really cool thing for a music historian to look at some of these parallels between Kanye and rock stars",

As long as you get 1500 song streams of any song off the one album, even if it\u2019s the same song being streamed 1500 times, that counts as an album sale.

And do you remember when he tweeted out the cover for that album? It was a photo of the plastic surgeon who Kanye blamed for causing his mother\u2019s death. He said of that album cover, that he wants to love everyone, including that plastic surgeon.\n\nNow look at the tweets he\u2019s been putting out lately, the features supposedly appearing on Yandhi, who he wanted to host SNL when he performs. They are all people, like the plastic surgeon, who have done something wrong in the past and made mistakes. ASAP Bari, Tekashi69, XXXtentacion, Louis CK. \n\nHis actions right now are in line with the message he was trying to promote back then. I think, if anything, it\u2019s been the few months since the infamous TMZ interview and now where Kanye hasn\u2019t been 100% sincere. He faced a lot of backlash for everything he wa saying back then, so he made an entirely new album, moved back to Chicago, tried to rebrand himself and distance himself from the \u201cLove Everyone\u201d-era Kanye. But I don\u2019t think it was sincere. I think he 100% believed in everything he was saying back then. I think he genuinely does like Trump. I think he\u2019s been listening to black conservatives like Candice Owens and Thomas Sowell and genuinely agrees with what they are saying. I think he genuinely feels people who have fucked up and done terrible things in their past deserve forgiveness and love. I think he believes these things so much that he\u2019s decided to be true to himself now and release Yandhi, which seems like (based on his recent actions and words) an updated version of \u201cLove Everyone.\u201d\n\nI think this is who Kanye is guys. Like or not. This is what he believes. It\u2019s not just for controversy (although I think purposely going against what he as a black celebrity is expected to say and believe is a big part of it). That\u2019s why after all these months he\u2019s back to the same MAGA-hat shenanigans again. He couldn\u2019t let it go because he actually believed in whatever statement he thinks he\u2019s making by wearing it.",

This was my favorite song on the album.\n\nAll Mine was decent but it didn't amaze me, just underwhelming for a Kanye song.\n\nWouldn't Leave sucked and it didn't feel like a Kanye song. \n\nNo Mistakes was okay at best to me, would've rather heard it lumped in somewhere on KSG than on Ye as a filler track there instead. Very lukewarm but not bad.\n\nI really like Ghost Town but 070 Shake's part is overrated and kind of cheesy to me. If it ended before her part or if they found a way to only include her wailing \"freeeeeeee\" with the sound effect and  nothing else coming out of her mouth it would've been so much better. This and Yikes are the only 2 songs I genuinely liked a lot. Ghost Town could've been better without 070 Shake or with a different girl singing her part. I love Kid Cudi's song \"Maniac\", if they chopped up 070 Shake's voice to sound like the distorted parts of that track then Ghost Town would've been so much better.\n\nI actually like 070 Shake's part on Voilent Crimes but I don't like the song overall so that's disappointing. Ty Dolla $ign just felt wasted here, I loved him on Jaded but he's not doing anything on this song to salvage it for me. It just felt like a super boring song, it's nice for being an outro because it feels like the conclusion to an album but I'm not a fan enough of the album to listen to it in order on the regular and on it's own the only use I would have for this track is putting it on a playlist to fall asleep to. I've literally fallen asleep listening to this song which is nice but I wouldn't ever go out of my way to listen to it. \n\n\nYikes and Ghost Town were enough to justify the album for me because 2 great songs out of 7 is better than nothing but Ye didn't feel like a Kanye album (in a bad way). Yikes could've been saved for a better project like Yandhi and Ghost Town could've been tossed on KSG to make that album even better. Listening to Ye front to back on the regular with no skips is a chore which is sad because it's only 7 tracks. At 2/7 tracks being the only above average songs that's not even half the album that I really like.\n\n\n\nTLOP was a much better project as a whole and felt more consistent with what I wanted. I'm hoping Yandhi is more like Yeezus and TLOP than Ye but if it is like Ye I hope it's either better or exclusively reminds me of Yikes and Ghost Town.",

Pusha T being exactly the kind of asshole/douchbag/jerkoff that the song is about. no emotional investment in the relationship, only in it for the pussy. \"im an asshole, take it or leave it.\" and kanyes advice chimes in again. run away as fast as you can. Kanye features Pushas verse...but it isnt praising its attitude. its just an example. its context and contrast for the rest of the song. if anything, Kanye is admonishing pushas attitude.\n\n\ni dont know if he is planning the same kind of idea for Yandhi, but its a thought. its an interesting concept. what if he brought in a bunch of people with a shady past, and used their features for songs about redemption and second chances. what their features were either apologies, or at least repent? \n\nalso, i think one of Gandhis themes was unconditional love. its easy to love a good role model, but are they the ones that need it? is it not virtuous to love (not praise) but love those who need it the most? those who might be the hardest to love? \n\nim just speculating here. i dont know. all im saying, is settle down, wait a couple days, and see.",

According to rumors we know Ye sounds completely different from this Love Everything/Yandhi album. \n\nHere is a supposed [Yeezy Engineer](https://imgur.com/a/MmazpXf) saying they haven't recorded much at all since Ye released along with tons of other info.\n\nHe claims that Ghost Town and Violent crimes are slightly edited versions of songs originally supposed to be on Love Everybody. Also supposedly a track of Ye was originally supposed to be a 2Chainz song but they redid a few lyrics and recorded it because there was no way they could have had the song they were working on done in time. I'd be willing to bet its either Yikes or All Mine as they have the least personal lyrics out of the bunch.\n\nOther interesting things he mentions is that Lift Yourself was 75% done but Ye decided to scrape it and put out the Lift Yourself with troll lyrics. He described the whole album as \"inspirational, emotional, and touching stuff.\" \n\nNow what we know is the album isn't even done and Ye doesn't look like he has been in the studio that much to finish it. According to [the fader](https://www.thefader.com/2018/09/27/kanye-west-fader-maga-hat-kaepernick), besides the 6ix9ine, x, and Ty Dolla $ign feature, Rihanna is supposed to be doing a hook which is yet to be recorded. Is really all thats missing from the album to finish the song with Rihanna? Possibly, but I don't see this looking promising.\n\nAgain this is all mostly rumors, but from Ye's activity on Insta/Twitter I 100% believe its possibly he hasn't recorded much since the Wyoming sessions. But, this will likely be the Love Everything album before Ye.\n",

The reason I think *ye* was sandwiched in between other releases was because it wasn't on the same pedestal as his other full-length albums. It fit into the mini album series (all of which he gets a lot of credit for since he produced them), and I think he knew it wasn't going to receive the same commercial and critical reception as his normal albums - like *Yandhi* likely will for example. \n\nAnd that's very true - they have talked about a 7-song album. But that was a while back. It might be optimistic, but I think it's likely that it will be at least 10 songs. Looking back at those 7-song albums, they all feel incomplete except for *Daytona.* Kanye and Chance being in Chicago has much more inherent momentum than the other albums, and I think when they realize how flush with good music they are, that momentum will translate into more than 7 songs worth of material.

He\u2019s on a creative streak. \n\nI think Yandhi will be divisive though. Some will love it, some will hate it. His most recent albums have all been divisive. Yeezus was really divisive and this looks like it\u2019s some kind of follow-up to that. But divisive doesn\u2019t necessarily mean bad. I don\u2019t think Kanye is capable of making bad music.

Jay is a goodass rapper but he's not a favorite of mine. I bump The Black Album all day but the rest of his material doesn't have any connection or whatever to me. \n\nYandhi is a bit more interesting. Yeezus is of a similar position as WTT for me, and I'd rate both fairly low if I were to rate Ye's discography. HOWEVER, Ye's recent material has been TOP FUCKING NOTCH, and seeing him explore these new themes but with a more experimental edge could result in the album of the year. \n\nThe reason why I'm most excited for Good Ass Job is because it has everything going for it. Not only has Kanye's recent work in general been excellent, but Kids See Ghosts in particular was the best thing he's put out since MBDTF (and I consider MDBTF to be his best album). Not only that but Kanye and Chance just fucking work well together, and all of their songs from TLoP are the *highlights* of the album. Even more amazing, this album is likely to be a rehash of the College Trilogy, which is also some of Kanye's best material. Oh, and fucking Chance the Rapper.

So maybe a weird cross of Ye and Yeezus? Who knows but I\u2019m excited either way. Not a single solo album I dislike from the man. I\u2019m confident this  album will be the same.  \n\nNot necessarily a huge fan of WTT as a whole although some songs are obviously classics. Mostly I\u2019m just not a fan of Jay Z so some of the album is hard to get into and kanye is also not really on his A game compared so solo shit. But that goes for cruel winter too (even tho I like it a lot still). Not bad just good and I won\u2019t be mad if theres more, just don\u2019t love it as much as his solo stuff and KSG is way better. \n\nGood Ass Job. I\u2019m intrigued and excited even, but in my mind this only works if it\u2019s a certain style. I need this to be Acid Rap Chance and Ye/Yeezus/808s type Kanye. I just really don\u2019t want gospel type hip hop like their couple collabs they have. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like what they have made previously, I just don\u2019t want a full album of that. This one only works for me if it\u2019s that\u2019s certain style, or maybe something completely new and different. Guess we\u2019ll see!",

So I think it\u2019s real for that reason. We know he had an album nearly completed that he ditched before he made ye. Now he\u2019s changed his mind and decided to release that album after all. That\u2019s what I think is going on.",

And keep in mind I\u2019m saying this as one of the biggest Kanye stans I\u2019ve seen on this sub.\n\nFirst off, despite the similarities between the Yeezus album cover and this new tweet, I doubt this is Yeezus 2. Does Kanye seem like the same type of person he was while recording Yeezus? At that point in his life he was angry at the fashion industry for not accepting him, angry at the public, angry at the radio/music charts and just generally frustrated. I highly doubt that Kanye is going to release that unreleased Yeezus B-Sides album Rick Rubin talked about, even though I\u2019d love that. Ye is a different person in 2018 then he was in 2013, for better or for worse.\n\nSo I think that leaves us with two possibilities. One being that this is the scrapped Wyoming album made before the MAGA bullshit, and the other being that this is an album comprised of the kind of music we have seen on Kanye\u2019s instagram lately, seemingly inspired by his trips to Columbia and his return to Chicago. I\u2019d suggest going to @teamkanyedaily or Kanye\u2019s account on instagram to see all of the songs he\u2019s previewed. They seem to be kind of sing-songy with no rapping from what we\u2019ve seen. His singing is super off-key but that's to be expected before it\u2019s fixed up in post with Ye, so we will see how this turns out.\n\nOthers have also pointed out that Kanye sings \u201c80 degrees\u201d on one of the songs previewed on ig, and the cover art he tweeted says \u201c80\u201d. This is more proof that this is the kind of music we will see on this new project.\n\nSo yeah, my prediction is were getting a feel-good album called \u201cYandhi\u201d (what he called himself on the SNL Card) as a polar opposite to Yeezus, which is why Kanye chose that cover.\n\nBut to be honest its Kanye so he could definitely be fucking with all of us right now, who am I to say what Ye is thinking.",
